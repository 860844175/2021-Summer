energy oil output energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost oil production but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods herrington said such plan would cost 200 mln dlrs year the white house reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal herrington proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department report on energy and the national security the report said oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security he has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria increase production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third he said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production in any case officials say president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and gasoline tax options which meet herrington criteria include loan price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs five pct tax credit for exploration and development it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels day at cost of 740 mln dlrs year five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures it would increase production by 80 000 barrels day at cost of 65 mln dlrs lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs herrington also pressed anew for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the arctic national wildlife refuge which may hold nine billion barrels herrington said he understood the reagan reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his department energy security study would make strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry another move herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house is to raise the fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100 000 barrels day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000 this he said would further bolster national security in case of an oil supply disruption
thatcher defends uk oil policy in saudi interview british prime minister margaret thatcher denied in an interview published in saudi arabia today that her government oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices she said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the north sea we believe these must be matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies she told the arabic language daily al sharq al awsat in an interview coinciding with visit to london by king fahd of saudi arabia thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as north sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs barrel british production was on plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future she said we naturally share the concern of saudi arabia and other opec members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries thatcher said on our part we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility

opec wants 18 dlr oil price oapec official opec believes world oil prices should be set around fixed average price of 18 dlrs barrel oapec assistant general secretary abdelaziz al wattari said today in speech to european community ec oapec opec seminar in luxembourg released here al wattari said opec believes the world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around fixed average price of 18 dlrs but he warned that defense of the 18 dlr barrel level had caused hardship for opec countries who had been forced to curtail production and he warned that such cutbacks by opec states could not be sustained in some cases for opec to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs barrel its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production al wattari said such cutbacks cannot in certain cases be sustained al wattari said as well as financial and marketing pressures some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies he added al wattari noted that total opec output was below the organization agreed ceiling for all member countries in february although this had meant sacrifices the effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability though restored to good level was still under pressure al wattari said lasting stability in the world market requires wider scope of international cooperation he added he said some non opec oil producing countries had shown political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with opec but although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by opec they were insufficient in terms of volume he added the overall majority of non opec producers have not responded sufficiently to opec calls for supply regulation he said al wattari said an 18 dlr barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside opec to continue while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high cost areas outside opec such price would no longer encourage protectionist measures he added fadhil al chalabi opec deputy secretary general also addressing the seminar added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market cooperation between arab states and europe was advantageous for both sides al chalabi said adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full fledged euro arab dialogue

saudi oil minister sees no need to alter pact saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer said opec december agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it nazer in an interview with reuters and the television news agency visnews said saudi arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day bpd of crude oil well below its opec quota saudi arabia the world largest oil exporter will continue to restrain production as long as other opec members adhere to the pact nazer said the 13 nation opec agreed in december to cut its production ceiling by 25 pct to 15 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs barrel from february nazer in his first interview since succeeding ahmed zaki yamani last october said do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of june when our next opec meeting will take place as scheduled nazer said opec was producing below 15 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements we ve heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified he said opec production curbs have boosted world oil prices from 13 year low of around eight dlrs barrel last august to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the december pact spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in february but have firmed in the past two weeks to near opec levels as traders gained confidence in opec price and output discipline nazer said saudi arabia would continue to produce below its 133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price as long as all the opec members adhere to the program as devised in december saudi arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement he said current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the neutral zone shared with kuwait but not sales from floating storage nazer said king fahd of saudi arabia in an interview with reuters and visnews on march 11 said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non opec producers to avoid harmful competition with opec saudi arabia doesn decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability he said nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to role of swing producer within opec saudi arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in august 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over production by some opec states saudi arabia is not playing that role it is being played by opec membership as whole because the reduction in the 15 mln bpd share of opec in the market is being shared by other members of opec nazer said nazer said opec estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16 mln bpd but he said if circumstances changed am sure then the opec members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures oil analysts say the opec pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non opec producers norway egypt and the soviet union agreed to help opec by restraining production or exports after he visited them on opec behalf earlier this year we did not ask any country to do anything these were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions nazer said he said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate such as britain to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit

division seen on how to help oil industry the congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices and the subsequent growth in oil imports industry analysts said the industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better said daniel yergin director of cambridge energy research associates which recently completed survey of the congress on energy issues yergin said he saw mounting support within congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee today energy secretary john herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the reagan administration for consideration white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed herrington said would like to shoot for one mln barrels day addition to production oil output was off to mln bpd in the week of march 13 down six pct from last year the american petroleum institute said oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs barrel for the year and many believe that move above that level will be unlikey for the near term paul mlotok oil analyst for salomon brothers inc said that even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we ve only altered our average price scenerio to about 17 50 dlrs for the year analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration john lichtblau president of the petroleum industry research foundation inc in new york in recent testimony to congress said the continuing decline in oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario but the future rate of decline is very much function of world oil prices and government policy lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time lowering the producing industry tax burden would probably be slower stimulant to output than price increase but would not raise energy costs lichtblau said but the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee ronald tappmeyer president of the international association of drilling contractors said the members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only variable oil import fee that sets minimum price trigger can protect our nation the association represents some 300 drilling and oil service companies the cera survey of congress shows that the oil import fee will face stiff uphill battle yergin said that the poll which was conducted in january by former congressman orval hansen showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the congressmen surveyed largely as means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry at the same time 48 pct of the congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests but 80 pct of the sample said support for fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise yergin said that imports above 50 pct of requirements is critical symbolic level if they imports move above that level fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action but lichtblau in telephone interview said 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 in 1986 oil imports rose to 33 pct of energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 he added

energy drilling industry the drastic cutbacks in drilling last year are rapidly deflating the united state natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said faltering deliverability of natural gas commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current rig count to near 000 by 1990 some analysts said the need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring resurgence of activity in the gulf of mexico offshore waters where some of the nation largest gas reserves are located we think an upturn in drilling is imminent said james crandall an analyst with salomon brothers inc many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they re betting that the gas market will be back in balance in year or two the prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs barrel to less than half that today relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs barrel are not enough to spur return to the heady days of 1981 when the drilling rig count soared to record high of more than 500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages the latest weekly hughes tool co lt ht rig count barometer of the oil industry health showed 761 rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year in 1986 the hughes rig count began the year at 915 but dived to post world war ii low of 663 in july as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times ike kerridge hughes economist said in 1986 the united states replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won be any better this year he added we don have the options we do with oil imports of gas from canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost only about trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates george gaspar an oil analyst with robert baird and co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for new cycle of gradual increases in drilling we anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies that means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid 1988 gaspar said gasper said he sees new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 000 in december of 1989 much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years some of the industry biggest companies such as exxon corp lt xon mobil corp mob and union texas petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the gulf of mexico crandall said for example conoco inc dupont lt dd subsidiary will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the gulf of mexico deepest production platform which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day but boone pickens who has acquired huge texas and kansas gas reserves for his mesa limited partnership lt mlp in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of recovery pickens predicts the rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do the rigs won go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs barrel said pickens 58 adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 000 again in his lifetime tenneco inc lt tgt one of the largest gas producers is skeptical that need for additional gas drilling exists tenneco vice president joe foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years supply current spot market prices of about 50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said

energy petrochemical industry cheap oil feedstocks the weakened dollar and plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf corp lt gaf privately held cain chemical inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants oil companies such as ashland oil inc lt ash the kentucky based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money making petrochemical businesses to buy see us poised at the threshold of golden period said paul oreffice chairman of giant dow chemical co lt dow adding there no major plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones analysts say the chemical industry biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said oreffice speaking at meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong dollar dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs believe the entire chemical industry is headed for record year or close to it oreffice said gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the chemical industry would report 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 last year the domestic industry earned total of 13 billion dlrs 54 pct leap from 1985 the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by combination of luck and planning said pace john dosher dosher said last year fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early 1980s finally virtually all major chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses the restructuring touched

chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse grace lt gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some

profitable specialty chemicals that are custom designed for small group of buyers companies like dupont lt dd and monsanto co lt mtc spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said but think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market some top

energy california oil production drilling for oil in california is likely to continue at last year sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices industry analysts said because much of the crude oil in california fields is thick heavy and expensive to extract oil prices would have to increase to near 1985 levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling they said companies will probably only drill their best prospects said john curti an analyst with birr wilson securities inc few new wells now are being drilled only 33 rigs about one quarter of the total available were drilling for oil onshore in california last week compared to about 70 last year said bill bolster of munger oil information services which tracks california drilling activity it in the dregs right now said bolster of the state drilling activity current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling said ed malmgreen of the california independent producers association while an organization of petroleum exporting countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year prices eventually fell prices for california marker grade line 63 blend have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from high of about 17 dlrs more than half of california oil comes from stripper wells those producing less than 10 barrels day and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs barrel to extract malmgreen said it not unusual for stripper well to cost 18 dlrs malmgreen said many stripper wells along the southern california coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick heavy oil he said the outlook for future production in california is clouded by lack of exploratory drilling now analysts said in the heart of california oil patch kern county which produces about two thirds of the state oil exploratory drilling has slowed to crawl only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in kern county in 1986 compared to 137 in 1985 according to david mitchell of the state energy commission so far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled don think they ll even get to what they did last year mitchell said no pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade mitchell said along with the fall in drilling has come decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production between february and october of 1986 the number of producing oil wells in california fell 14 pct to 43 521 from more than 50 000 said bill guerard of the california energy commission in line with that decrease california crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level analysts said between february and october 1986 california crude oil production slipped from an all time high of 185 mln barrels per day to 066 mln bpd guerard said total estimated crude oil production in california for 1986 was 408 mln bbls compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983 according to the california department of conservation production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels guerard said

oecd trade growth seen slowing in 1987 the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the economist intelligence unit eiu said the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to pct this year compared with pct growth forecast in december it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences and japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to pct from pct in december and to pct from three pct for japan it said it expected the oecd to post current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in large part to 50 dlrs barrel rise in 1987 oil prices it said the current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 it said it expected west germany to post 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan 76 billion dlr surplus this year the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16 50 dlrs barrel by end 1987 and 15 50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly ragged it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose further 13 pct on its trade weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year 18 pct drop the average mark dollar rate is put at 80 marks this year and 70 in 1988 while the yen dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said this is not crash scenario but the dollar steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with fireball rather than three point landing the eiu said talking will not stop the dollar slide for long and the february meeting of finance ministers of the group of five and canada produced scant promise of either decisive shift to more expansive policies in west germany and japan or tighter fiscal policy it said it said the key to the dollar fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy government assets despite prospects of sustaining currency loss thus far they have been willing the eic said adding that if japan was deterred from buying bonds the dollar would collapse to contain such currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and third world debt crisis it said on trade the eiu said prospects for 1987 look increasingly sick import growth forecast in december at pct is now seen slowing down to around pct in 1987 with recovery only to pct in 1988 it said the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature sluggish pct growth in 1987 against the pct forecast in december the eiu said on the export side it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe while japan exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by exporters would respond only marginally to lower more competitively priced dollar it said in most of europe and in japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 however rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current oecd average of three pct non oil commodity prices will show modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984 the eiu said after rise of 18 pct in 1986 the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988 it said it said oecd industrial production would rise by only pct in 1987 after weak pct increase in 1986

lawmakers support gulf action american lawmakers rallied behind president reagan for the strike against iranian targets in the gulf but the attack fueled sharp new white house congress debate over limits on his powers to make war the pentagon announced on monday that warships destroyed non producing oil platform used for monitoring gulf ship traffic and military operations and also raided second iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier iranian attack on kuwaiti ship flying the american flag many democrats who control congress and republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate measured response but democrats and liberal republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between tehran and the united states could erupt into major war and demanded that reagan comply with the 1973 war powers act which could lead to pullout of american forces from the waterway those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as tacit endorsement of war with iran said sen mark hatfield of oregon republican

lawson oil tax breaks to help new fields revenue two new tax relief measures for oil producers announced today are aimed at encouraging developments in the north sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry the inland revenue said in post budget statement earlier chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced in his annual budget to parliament that from today companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against petroleum revenue tax prt to date full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself when its income stream began but was not immediately available against other development expenditure the statement said the new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today and will improve the post tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed it said lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for prt relief to be offset against prt liability this means oil related expenditure in the or on the continental shelf which has not become allowable in particular field within three years of being incurred to be allowed against prt liability in any oil field the inland revenue said this brings the scope of prt relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs it said in due course the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg year it calculated the inland revenue statement also included other technical measures that lawson did not comment on in his budget speech these included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of prt exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation tidier rules on incorrectly allowed prt expenditure reliefs were announced while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and advance corporation tax relating to the so called ring fence of activities in the and its continental shelf the finance bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in november it said gareth lewis davies north sea expert with stockbrokers wood mackenzie and co inc in edinburgh thought the two reliefs on prt would help the depressed offshore industry he said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller north sea fields such osprey don and arbroath would be brought forward early development of the larger miller and bruce oil fields might also be encouraged he said lewis davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry which suffered huge amount of lay offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year he pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the southern basin this means more jobs could be created as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the north sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south he said the prt relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year

world dependency on mideast oil said inevitable the world dependency on the mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it donald mcivor an exxon corp lt xon director and senior vice president told reuters in an interview non opec production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on opec and the middle east is inevitable mcivor said decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change growing dependence mcivor said mcivor exxon senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the mideast large spare capacity at time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding since 1970 we ve been consuming oil at rates of 20 25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10 15 bilion barrels per year mcivor said the bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity he added mcivor said that of the some 30 000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 one one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered mcivor said in response to question that he did not believe there were any more super giants or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels to be found which would change the conclusion of the world growing dependency of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the middle east only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east cantarell in mexico and alaska north slope mcivor said mcivor said that many of the large fields outside the like alaska prudhoe bay and the north sea were reaching peak and would soon begin to decline but the exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the middle east particulartly in canada the north sea and australia and africa mcivor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies the ideal regime is stable one not one where there is constant change in policies mcivor said mcivor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy asked about the options offered this week by energy secretary herrington to increase production mcivor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but the thrust of his herrington report is valid it has highlighted the growing dependency on the middle east and the need to increase production mcivor also said that he expected natural gas to play greater role in the future in meeting energy needs natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd energy supply mcivor said crude oil will be used more and more as transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat as an industrial fuel he added
iea forecasts slower growth in oecd oil demand growth in oil consumption in the western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with pct in 1986 the international energy agency said oil use in the 24 member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35 mln barrels day the iea said in its latest monthly report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as was the case in 1986 but if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year pct the iea said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that takes place natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 it said iea estimates on april one put oil stocks held in the oecd area at 428 mln tonnes or 98 days of forward consumption this is about the same as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset reduction in stocks company stocks on land in the oecd rose to 326 mln tonnes on april one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986 the year on year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years iea said oil stocks on land in the united states and canada were put at 206 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on january one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively oil stocks in western europe were 147 mln tonnes down from the 154 mln tonnes on january one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption the iea said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed small rise in january of 400 000 bpd but decline of bpd in february and bpd in march and it is possible that final data will show larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said world oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45 bpd from 47 bpd in the last quarter of 1986 this drop was mostly due to decline in opec crude production to around 15 bpd in february march from 16 bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies the iea said total opec oil supply totalled 17 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non opec countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28 bpd in the same 1986 period drop in saudi arabian output to tentatively forecast bpd in march from bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said

australian minister sees targeted oil tax strategy australia crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of targeted rather than broadly based approach federal resources and energy minister gareth evans told meeting here he told the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference there was prospect of developing package that would recognise the government economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry concerns evans was referring to nearly completed government review of oil taxation evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years these include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on old bass strait oil found before september 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last september he said the industry through the apea has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against background of weak prices and australia relatively low exploration levels while nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas evans said he said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation rrt legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in given area to be deductible as previously reported rrt is tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects apea has said it is not true profit based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects evans said the decision not to change rrt was based more than anything on the government desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules

opec president says output well below ceiling opec conference president rilwanu lukman said the group was producing well below the 15 mln bpd ceiling it set in december partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed opec prices lukman during brief visit to london on his way home from jamaica told reuters in telephone interview that in february opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs barrel we are determined to stand firm by the december accord he said have spoken to every other opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work he said lukman gave no specific figures for february output he said the opec secretariat in vienna was finalizing these figures told of reuters survey published today which estimated that opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd he said that could well be correct opec news agency opecna today issued statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in february but it gave no figures but one source close to opec indicated that february output may have been between 15 and 15 mln bpd the reuter survey estimated opec february output at around 16 mln bpd opec agreed in december to cut output by 25 pct to 15 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting february lukman said qatar nigeria saudi arabia and iran had all produced in february below their opec quotas iraq which said it would not honour its 466 mln bpd quota under the december pact had produced less than had been anticipated he said lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in february nigeria propuced 75 100 000 bpd below its 238 mln bpd quota saudi arabia 500 000 bpd less than its 133 mln allocation and qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285 000 bpd quota he said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet north sea grades and the united states west texas intermediate wti crude however he said opec in december had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks we have to be patient for two or three weeks the market is now firming on actual fundamentals he said adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early april this is when traditionally there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as nigeria the opec president said producers such as kuwait venezuela and indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products also some of venezuela heavy grades were outside the opec pricing system he said lukman said that if refiner buyers now refusing to lift some opec oil at official prices instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels they would eventually have to buy opec oil when they realise it is not free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on he said lukman asked about industry reports that nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable flexible and under constant review not only when the market seemed weak he said that so far no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such meeting now twice postponed was not high priority for opec at the moment at this time we have to get our priorities right he said the most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working not dealing with differential of cents between grades but if any opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system meeting would be called he said

royal dutch shell earnings sharply lower royal dutch shell group lt rd as earnings for 1986 from the fell sharply because of difficult market conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods shell chairman peter holmes said the shell oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg the group earlier reported drop in net income for the year to 54 billion stg from 03 billion previously with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts shell transport and trading plc lt sc shares the arm of the group rose to 11 39 stg from close last night of 11 06 stg analysts noted that general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 also windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts industry analyst chris rowland of barclays de zoete wedd noted however he added there could well be sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 the impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which typically reacted to oil price changes with about half year lag analysts said holmes said that in the upstream sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all only two of the oil majors had managed to make profit in the period with shell oil being one of them the decrease in earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader holmes added continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue exploration activity exploration is currently pretty flat we are going to go on but at 16 18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn he said renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the north sea and the requires prices of around 25 dlrs barrel ultimately this would lead to rise in imports if you are not exploring you are not going to find anything he noted oil production had dropped some half mln barrels day bbd in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs barrel this favored opec attempts to stabilise prices as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non opec marginal production shutting down opec has done pretty extraordinarily well everything is moving in its direction he added

lower tax offsets lower shell upstream profit lt shell ltd pre tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year shell finance director nigel haslam said but he told press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on north sea operations the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 45 billion in 1985 the bulk of tax last year was corporation tax with petroleum revenue tax prt representing only 16 mln stg he said as result post tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln earlier shell subsidiary of royal dutch shell group lt rd as reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg up from 667 mln in 1985 on sales of 57 billion stg against 81 mln shell chairman bob reid said the company crude oil output from the north sea was at record 373 000 bpd in 1986 which would almost certainly prove to be peak for the company shell expects fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340 000 bpd due mainly to the decline in output from the major brent field he said gas output of billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 he said final decision on development of the kittiwake and osprey north sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months reid said the kittiwake field originally part of the billion stg gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg economies on development costs for the tern and eider north sea fields which were approved last year have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant the company drilled 17 wells offshore with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries reid said restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985 jaap klootwijk managing director of downstream unit lt shell oil said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986 in november and december in particular refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices he said he expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer although they could dip to become negative from time to time depending on price movements new catalytic cracker at shell stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 about five months behind schedule following crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year he said profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the carrington chemical site haslam said the budget announcement on prt relief by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against prt was helpful but rather less than had been hoped for reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs if prices went much above that he would expect some over production above opec official 15 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down he said it looked as if the december opec pact to restrain output was holding bringing supply and demand into balance but the test will come in summer when demand for opec oil will fall

heineken sees higher profits wider penetration dutch brewer heineken nv said it hoped to maintain for number of years similar earnings growth to the pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986 despite continuing investments in reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration heineken last month reported 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders after 265 mln in 1985 chairman freddie heineken said the company europe leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986 said sales increased by pct to 42 mln hectoliters the volume increase was due mainly to rise in the where the brand amstel lite saw great demand and in europe where sales accounted for 25 pct of the total turnover despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies rose by pct to billion guilders further consolidation of foreign companies including the increase of its stake in leading spanish brewery lt el aguila to 51 pct new ventures and modernization particularly in french and spanish interests eroded profit margins the company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing heineken said heineken spanish activities should start yielding profit next year heineken said adding that its french operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year vice chairman gerard van schaik said the decision by the european court of justice in luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed west german market europe biggest beer market offered interesting possibilities for heineken we have the beer but distribution and sales is the important point van schaik said adding that since the ruling heineken had been inundated by german traders seeking joint ventures the question is not if we want to penetrate the german market but how we are to do it van schaik said adding that while the widely traveled germans seemed to be developing taste for foreign beer the internal structure was very regionalized heineken board member hans coebergh responsible for african operations said he saw africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term he said the company present in africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25 was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there africa where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks nonetheless accounted for pct of total 1986 sales on site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients but heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities to balance the costs of imported malt heinken launched on the nigerian market new beer made of 50 pct sorghum which had sold successfully coebergh said heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials but coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in rwanda this is possibility but we could not possibly achieve the heineken flavor coebergh said chairman heineken said the company seven year efforts to penetrate the soviet market had finally resulted this week in contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced but again lack of hard currencies limited heineken market potential heineken now has seven bars in moscow that are enjoying good sales but the bars only accept western money

commerzbank sees lower operating profit this year commerzbank ag lt cbkg management board chairman walter seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986 in the first two months of the year partial operating profit excluding trading on the bank own account declined he said without giving details the interest surplus fell pct compared with 12ths of 1986 results while the commission surplus because of the quiet stock exchange business fell back still more strongly by contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased german banks do not report full operating profit but seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this commenting on 1986 seipp said we were able to raise the full operating profit slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly he gave no concrete details but added that in january and february good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure the bank would as result be more profit oriented in future developing for example more into investment banking keeping tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets turning to 1986 results seipp said by year end there had been strong growth in business volume over the year business volume rose by pct to 93 billion marks compared with 1985 seipp added group balance sheet volume rose by pct to 148 15 billion it would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged in the parent bank the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year while the interest margin held roughly at 1985 56 pct despite pressure on credit rates the surplus on commission business which had soared by quarter in 1985 rose by 11 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions seipp said personnel expenditure was up 11 pct last year at more than billion marks fixed asset expenditure rose by pct to more than 650 mln as result the parent bank partial operating profit rose by pct to 752 mln marks parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985 seipp said extraordinary earnings included high two figure million in profit from the sale of the bank aeg ag lt aegg shares to daimler benz ag lt daig during the latter majority stake purchase booked last year the ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised as in prior years to its full extent because of numerous insolvencies at home by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write downs from domestic business abroad the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further seipp said that because about half the group exposure to problem nations was in dollars the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks this means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default he added despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks he said the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems all banks had significantly strengthened their capital base most european banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties he described debt equity swaps as very interesting new approach to indebted nations problems there was lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in latin america particularly from west german firms

ec agrees trade deal with argentina the european community ec agreed trade deal with argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of spain and portugal into the group ec officials said under the deal agreed by ec foreign ministers argentina will gain additional trading rights on series of products including meat fish and cereals by products but ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with canada and japan and are due to study these again the officials said the deal with argentina was agreed by majority of ec states after west germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for argentina on high quality beef ireland and france continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said under the deal argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the ec in particular the quota on high quality hilton beef will be raised by 500 tonnes to 34 300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 000 tonnes to 53 000 tonnes argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550 000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said the improved trade terms were offered after argentina said that spain and portugal entry into the ec affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries they have been negotiated under the rules of gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade but officials said ministers had been unable to resolve canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to spain had been affected by the country ec membership officials said the ec had asked gatt to arbitrate on the fish dispute with canada ministers also decided to continue talks with japan the ec claims that spain and portugal entry into the group has improved trade conditions for japan but has been unsatisfied with japanese offers of compensation japan main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid ec exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for spain and portugal ec external trade commissioner willy de clercq told journalists we maintain our position that the japanese concessions were not enough we hope that there will be an improvement he said
indonesian agriculture growth expected to slow indonesia agriculture sector will grow by just pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the embassy said in report production of indonesia staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 26 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 58 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on indonesia agricultural performance the government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 mln tonnes with forecast 27 mln tonnes output in 1987 the report says wheat imports are likely to fall to mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of drawdown on stocks growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower yielding more resistant rice types the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices palm oil production is expected to increase by over pct in 1987 to 45 mln tonnes from 35 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720 000 tonnes from 695 000 tonnes in 1986 the report says but while production of soybeans in 1987 88 oct sept will rise to 075 mln tonnes from 980 000 in 1986 87 imports will also rise to supply new soybean crushing plant the report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as result of last september 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of rise in domestic demand the report said that indonesia overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid 1960s it compares with pct growth in 1985 and pct in 1984 the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

oecd farm subsidies study results detailed the results of controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd show japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies results of the study which has not been released by oecd because of objections from some countries were provided to reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified the oecd study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979 81 using new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent pse the study shows that on dairy products japan pse or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as percentage averaged 83 pct over 1979 81 with the european community at 68 pct and the united states 48 pct for wheat japan pse averaged 95 pct the ec 28 and the 17 japan rice pse was 68 pct compared to the ec 13 and the pct the oecd calculations show in coarse grains japan subsidies reached 107 pct compared with 27 pct for the ec and 13 pct for the japan beef subsidy was 54 pct versus 52 pct for the ec and pct for the oecd concluded for sugar japan pse was 48 pct versus 27 pct in the ec and 13 pct for the the study shows the oecd calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as canada australia and new zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the ec and japan the sources said subsidies in argentina and brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the oecd work officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the oecd ministerial meeting in paris during may some officials hope the oecd results will be used as basis for negotiations during the uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in geneva british agriculture minister michael jopling during visit to washington this week endorsed the oecd work as starting point for the uruguay round negotiations on agriculture he said the pse calculations provide tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture however the oecd study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said the agriculture department economic research service recently published study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the oecd results and update them to 1982 84 in some cases the results were substantially different than the oecd in part because farm policies in both the and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 84 from the oecd base period of 1979 81 officials said for example the usda study found the united states subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the ec at zero to nine pct french maize producers association president marcel cazale citing the result of the usda calculation for corn told reporters last week that the united states subsidizes its farmers more than the ec however the sources said ec corn subsidies are probably higher than the now because of increases since 1984 officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to oecd so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation the updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in subsidy levels for sugar because the imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied marketing loan for rice officials added

brazil grain harvest faces storage problems storage problems with brazil record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an agriculture ministry spokesman said ministry spokesman leonardo brito speaking from brasilia told reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost he said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems brazil has storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop but brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed the states of sao paulo parana and rio grande do sul had between them 70 pct of the nation capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production the biggest problems are concentrated in the centre west growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity brito said the centre west whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space in addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain brito said finally there is shortage of lorries to transport the crops the sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries

awb calls for tighter wheat quality controls australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements the australian wheat board awb said many awb customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications the board said in submission to the royal commission into grain storage handling and transport many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in australia it said the commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower quality grades the awb submission said it stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping better industrial relations at grain terminals more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing it said the submission also said australia federal system impeded the awb role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat the awb called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment it is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored it said for example wheat grown in northern new south wales nsw might move more efficiently to brisbane in queensland than to sydney or newcastle in new south wales it said similarly southern nsw wheat might better be shipped to portland or geelong in victoria legislation giving state rail authorities monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment it said the awb said the current approach of state based bulk handling authorities is not essential although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained an appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26 500 and 34 700 dlrs to load 50 000 tonne vessel at various australian ports compared with 21 200 dlrs at houston and 16 300 at port cartier quebec for 60 000 tonner

corn market skewed by soviet buying recent purchases of corn by the soviet union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the gulf export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said many dealers expect the usda will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the gulf versus the interior which dealer in davenport iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents bushel by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain by lowering ascs county posted prices for corn the usda could encourage farmers to engage in pik and roll corn sales where pik certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed if the usda acts soon as many dealers expect the movement would break the gulf corn basis the usda has been using the gulf price to determine county posted prices one dealer said it should be taking the average of the gulf price and the price in kansas city which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior midwest but we don know when they might do it an ohio dealer said which has created uncertainty in the market the usda started the pik certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage yesterday usda issued report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 85 billion dlrs in pik certificates it has issued to farmers in lieu of cash payments had to date been exchanged for grain with several billion dlrs worth of additional pik certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the usda would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ascs prices cash grain dealers said byproduct of the soviet buying has been sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the midwest to the export terminals cash dealers said freight from upper areas of the mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price the mild winter and early reopening of the mid mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted the higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings they said the gulf market overreacted to the soviet buying reports which indicate the ussr has booked over two and perhaps as much as mln tonnes of corn one midwest cash grain trader said but dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the midwest river system

house approves pilot 92 disaster program the house of representatives approved bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant the one time pilot 92 program designed to assist farmers in kansas oklahoma michigan and parts of missouri was passed by 304 100 vote and sent to the senate although the bill includes narrow version of the 92 provision endorsed by the reagan administration the agriculture department withheld its support from the measure usda said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration proposed broad scale revision of farm programs the bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received to be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant different crop on that land this spring although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay usda estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs largely because of reduced crop forfeitures the bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the missouri and mississippi rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall flooding in addition the measure would require usda to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by congress last fall currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds usda plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses the administration said it opposed the bill because by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance usda also said the 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings usda said the 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the requirement to compensate fully disaster struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by congress the feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs usda estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs in january the senate approved bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments but the senate bill would not offer the 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program

commodity pacts more oriented towards market consuming countries chastened by the collapse of international tin council itc price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving reuter survey showed they want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non members undermining the pacts consumers and producers mindful of itc buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations importers and some key exporting countries have shunned generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed the international cocoa organization icco last week set precise limits on what the buffer stock manager bsm could do under the new agreement it imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the bsm from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non member cocoa this will help prevent lower quality cocoa from malaysia the world fourth largest producer undermining the market the cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the buffer stock manager must use when purchasing varying grades new international natural rubber agreement inra was adopted earlier this month in geneva importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases bank financing was particular feature of the failed itc buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling legal wrangles continue recent international coffee organization ico negotiations in london exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said consumers and small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant reduction in the share of brazil the world leading producer brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct the talks broke down and although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote international agreements exist for sugar and wheat these do not have any economic clauses but provide forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber the common fund for commodities with planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the nor the soviet union has ratified it officials in washington said the doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support officials in washington and malaysian officials in kuala lumpur expressed policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests we see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of commodity whose long term trend is downward official administration policy states the currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the international coffee agreement ica and inra but it is also member of the sugar and wheat pacts the did not join the international cocoa agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the state department said officials singled out the inra as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as market oriented agreement officials said canadian officials in ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik told reuters in kuala lumpur his country the world top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case malaysia is member of the association of tin producing countries atpc which produce 65 pct of world tin the atpc launched plan to limit member tin exports to 96 000 tonnes for year from march to cut the tin surplus to 50 000 from 70 000 economist in the west german ministry of agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements peter baron told reuters in london agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously but baron added no real sanctions are available for country that doesn stick to its obligations the german approach is sceptical we don think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries they were never meant to be vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be two way partnership in trade rather than disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through buffer stock have high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be foreign ministry official in tokyo said japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply government spokesman in paris said france is favourable to commodity pacts france large consumer and producer of sugar favours sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks indonesia foreign minister mochtar kusumaatmadja told reuters in jakarta these agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical but it another matter when there are structural problems but we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith nicaraguan external trade minister alejandro martinez cuenca said in london producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements the political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work martinez cuenca said the head of the economics department in the brazilian foreign ministry sebastiao do rego barros told reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps link with market reality if you have an agreement such as coffee with system of quotas with link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work unctad spokesman graham shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries

pakistan not seen as major wheat exporter pakistan is not emerging as major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough sartaj aziz special assistant on food and agriculture to the pakistani prime minister said in an interview no exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to iran came to nothing because they could not agree price he said aziz forecast that pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable the government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices and the land would be better used for other crops aziz said the pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds the aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current to tonnes per ha to at least tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years he said aziz said the current 1986 87 crop harvesting of which is just beginning is expected to yield around record 14 mln tonnes this compares with target of 14 mln and last year yield of 14 mln he said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly the long term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid 1993 taking into account pakistan annual population growth rate of more than three pct current consumption is some 12 mln tonnes the current wheat reserve is mln tonnes aziz said this compares with minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes which pakistan will maintain at all costs and strategic reserve target of two mln tonnes despite the fact that stocks are half mln tonnes over target the surplus will not be exported at present he said the government wants to keep an extra safety margin until it sees what effect the abolition of 44 year old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption new exports will be considered only in about year time when the 1987 88 crop can be gauged as well he said the new domestic policy introduced on march 15 is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo with other costs this means price in pakistani markets of between 30 and 50 rupees per kilo under the old system introduced during world war two and due to be phased out by april 15 some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply aziz said following the introduction of government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills the ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended aziz said prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system the wheat price in karachi the most expensive pakistani city had dropped from 11 rupees per kilo on march to 85 rupees on march 30 aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have major effect on total consumption but it may encourage better use of side products such as bran
zimbabwe maize output to fall 65 pct maize deliveries to zimbabwe state owned grain marketing board gmb will fall by over 65 pct this year following prolonged dry spell agricultural industry sources said they said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520 000 tonnes from mln tonnes last year about 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large scale commercial farmers and the balance by small scale peasant producers although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980 the sources said there is no danger of food shortage in zimbabwe while annual maize consumption is estimated at 750 000 tonnes the gmb stockpile is currently around mln tonnes which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years the sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315 000 tonnes from 248 000 tonnes last year and by rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100 000 tonnes from 84 000 tonnes in 1986

sugar program cut sent to congress by usda the agriculture department formally transmitted to congress long awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments in letter to the congressional leadership accompanying the sugar program improvements act of 1987 peter myers deputy agriculture secretary said the reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 the payments would cost an estimated billion dlrs myers said the administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the house of representatives next week by rep john porter ill congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the house or senate because politically influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist the direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years it also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 000 short tons raw sugar per grower for example on the first 350 tons of production grower would receive cts per lb in fiscal 1988 cts in 1989 cts in 1990 and cts in 1991 the income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years whichever is less usda said myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry he said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said this has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing furthermore usda said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar containing products competitive advantage the result has been higher imports of sugar containing products and flight of processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar usda also said the current program imposes heavy cost on consumers and industrial users in fiscal 1987 usda said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing myers said the following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administration proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments quantity 1988 1989 1990 1991 first 350 tons 000 500 000 500 over 350 to 700 750 313 875 438 over 700 to 000 500 125 750 375 over 000 to 500 000 750 500 250 over 500 to 000 500 375 250 125 over 000 to 000 500 625 750 875 over 000 to 10 000 250 688 125 563 over 10 000 to 20 000 500 375 250 125 over 20 000 tons nil nil nil nil

budget pact cuts farm funds 25 billion dlrs house and senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday to cut 25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs congressional sources told reuters the agreed cut in farm programs is compromise between billion sought by the senate and one billion by the house the negotiators also agreed to cut billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 45 billion in 1990 for total of billion in saving over three years sources said the agreement presents the house and senate agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments senior congressional aides told reuters some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings rep dan glickman kan chairman of the house grains subcommittee has introduced bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 28 dlrs and 92 dlrs respectively saying it would save 500 mln dlrs house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza has said the committee will consider the glickman proposal but congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from republican lawmakers and strong stance by agriculture secretary richard lyng who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings glickman claims another area where glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program arp levels for wheat and corn however on this issue also lyng has taken strong stand within the reagan administration arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the office of management and budget omb most commodity lobbyists expect lyng to prevail congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through arp increases would be to boost the 1988 corn arp but one informed congressional source said singling out corn for an arp increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity congressional sources said the areas where congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible adoption of 92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains those changes would achieve portion of the 25 billion but not enough they said ultimately congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across the board cut on all commodity credit corp payments to farmers including price support loans and deficiency payments similar to the gramm rudman hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986 this idea has been suggested by the american farm bureau federation afbf as the fairest approach for all commodities

sugar policy may self destruct congressman leading farm state congressman jerry huckaby la warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year we re moving toward direction where we could self destruct the sugar program rep huckaby chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues told reuters in an interview huckaby who told sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases said he will deliver the same message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday he also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject huckaby said the campaign to urge halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons think if we re talking about dropping the quota another half mln tons lets say you re getting to the point where the program might not work he said ideally like to freeze things right where we are said huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in congress freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of mln tons the corn sweetener share of the market staying at just over 50 pct and sugar imports holding at about mln tons huckaby said decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said feel like if we didn expand production we could probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program huckaby said however much depends on whether high fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the sweetener market from just over 50 pct huckaby said he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share then sugar imports might be eliminated and sugar output severely reduced huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as staley and archer daniels midland soon this program is advantageous to the corn users they have some natural legitimate self interest in seeing that the program is preserved huckaby said huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled either through production allocations acreage or marketing controls huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the justice department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production don know if we will go this route but if we do there question in my mind at this point in time can you do that legally he said asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners huckaby said you build fragile house if you do it that way huckaby said he understands why cane and beet farmers have expanded production because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain but he said for sugar growers as whole expansion would not be good policy huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program the administration proposal is so drastic that don think it will get up head of steam huckaby said he said even more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program huckaby said the reagan administration should file complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade against the european community sugar policy he said ec policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market
more soviet grain buying from tied to price whether the soviet union will fulfill its buying obligations under the ussr grains agreement depends entirely on the united states soviet trade official told reuters how can tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the united states does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices said albert melnikov deputy trade representative of the soviet union to the united states we are in the market for grains but it is up to the united states to be the seller to offer soviets competitive prices he said in an interview melnikov said that the united states has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to moscow grain at prevailing market prices we are being accused of not implementing this agreement we do not consider we are at fault melnikov said article in the agreement states that purchases sales of commodities under this agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms the united states should supply to the soviet union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices is the united states ready to supply this he said the soviet official said that near term corn demand has been met by the recent soviet purchases of corn which he confirmed at mln tonnes but said that if corn prices remain competitive the soviets will buy more if they need it wheat buying however is different story melnikov said if the united states is interested in selling its wheat then they must offer competitive prices and it up to the united states to decide how these competitive prices will be offered he said last year offer of subsidized wheat to the soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy melnikov said he said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels

india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gap india is searching for non communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told reuters most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in 1984 comes from two state trading firms the state trading corp stc and the minerals and metals trading corp mmtc the two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indian exports commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading one trade source said india has targetted countries that depend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports however countertrade deals still make up only small part of india total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended december the sources said countertrade accounted for just five pct of india 25 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 86 ended march against almost nothing in 1984 85 official figures show however the figures exclude exchanges with the eastern bloc paid in non convertible indian rupees the sources said total trade with the soviet union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and crude oil is estimated at 04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986 87 against three billion in 1985 86 indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country large trade deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia venezuela and brazil the trade sources said the trade deficit which hit an estimated record 96 billion dlrs in 1985 86 is expected to decline to billion in the current fiscal year but the push to include non communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said one source said india is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break gatt rules as member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt india cannot officially support bartering the mmtc recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails mmtc recent global tenders now include clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to india trade official said adding that the policy remains flexible we also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to india the trade official said early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs and railway equipment to india that they stood better chance if they bought indian goods or services in return the trade sources said illustrating the point the official said south korean firm recently agreed to sell drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state run oil and natural gas commission in return the south koreans gave verbal assurance to buy indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract against the 25 pct sought by new delhi the trade official said we selected the korean firm because its bid was the lowest he added countertrade is helping african countries short of foreign currency to import goods india has signed trade protocol to buy up to 15 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from zimbabwe in exchange for indian goods including jute bags and cars but despite india new drive countertrade has some inherent problems they added it is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced one trade source said the other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants another added barter is also restrictive we look upon it as temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty this is why countertrade has not been made law in india it does not even figure in the country foreign trade policy

analyst says ussr winter grains hurt by weather the soviet union winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said grain analyst and meteorologist gail martell author of the ef hutton publication global crop news said in her latest report that the soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the due to potential crop damage compared with last year the outlook for the soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said but it still too early to talk about disastrous losses lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains key wheat growing areas of the southern ukraine and north caucasus received on 25 35 pct of autumn precipitation she said the bitter winter cold temperatures which broke record lows that had stood for four decades also may have taken its toll on soviet winter crops she said however she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have well insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage the ussr has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the july 1986 june 1987 marketing year primarily from canada the european community argentina and australia martell said she cited number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional soviet import demand last fall dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture depleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy martell was also skeptical of soviet claim for 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports however she said the remains supplier of last resort for the soviet union noting that the soviets have only just recently begun their first grain purchases of the 1986 87 season by buying 25 mln tonnes of corn martell cited usda statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the is only major supplier of grain to the ussr during years of heavy soviet demand in 1984 85 the supplied 41 pct of record soviet grain imports of 55 mln tonnes but in 1985 86 the soviet union bought 29 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the for only 24 pct of that total while the usda soviet import target for grain for 1986 87 was 22 mln tonnes many grain analysts have revised their estimates of soviet imports up to 25 28 mln tonnes she said

iwc says effect of lower support prices limited efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the international wheat council iwc says in its latest monthly report faster results could be achieved by policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the united states the iwc says in survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters argentina australia canada the ec and the in some countries for example australia and argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for long period this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency for example between 1985 86 and 1986 87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 30 to 179 44 european currency units ecus it dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 the high cost of supporting farm prices has put strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 this was partly due to increased production in china and india the period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the argentina the and australia by lower acreages in argentina reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower acreages are attributed to official incentives

soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to good start and will have lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as 30 35 pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be problem there good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and late spring would require longer off pasture feeding they said the soviets are not in desperate situation they don have to buy grains now usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and half martell said

sri lanka appeals for drought relief aid sri lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help mln villagers affected by the country worst drought in 36 years government officials said embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for sixth of sri lanka population in 13 districts the letter said the government had to step in to avert serious economic hardship and because the social services ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas the letter said 548 76 mln rupees were needed for six month period at least until the may september yala rice crop was harvested over 25 000 tonnes of wheat rice flour and other cereals were required it said along with supplies of sugar lentils dried or canned fish and milk in some of the most seriously affected districts the maha october 1986 april 1987 crop had been almost completely devastated the letter said maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels 20 mln less than originally expected there were two scenarios for the yala crop with high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks should the present drought continue however production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels the letter added total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels or 35 to 65 mln tonnes of rice last year output was 124 mln bushels down from 127 mln in 1985 the letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed it said the government current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side the 548 76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family as well as handling transport and distribution of emergency food but such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects or greatly fuelling inflation in the economy the letter said the letter said the food department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements provided such stocks are replaced subsequently the meteorological department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late may the letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since august and in the rice growing district of kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since june 1986

glickman pushes hard for 92 farm plan implementation of one year 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of key house agriculture subcommittee as way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions we have budget driven farm policy it may be shame but we are locked into this said dan glickman kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains we need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer 92 plan if properly done could do both glickman announced this week plans to introduce 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains an aide to glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week glickman said 92 program which allows farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be major revision of the 1985 farm bill only an extension of the 50 92 option already provided under the current bill it is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals voluntary 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as usda has proposed 92 plan however would not be decoupling but simply different type of acreage diversion program glickman said decoupling delinking planting decisions from government payments is too much of policy change to approve at this point he said don think there is any interest in pursuing decoupling bill this year period unequivocal glickman said at the hearing sen rudy boschwitz minn cosponsor of the boren boschwitz decoupling plan said he supports short term 92 program as move to more permament decoupling plan boschwitz plans to introduce 92 plan in the senate his plan would guarantee certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to certain number of acres in county and provide tenant protection provisions know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction boschwitz said robbin johnson vice president of cargill inc testified in favor of decoupling decoupling would end the current bias in farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant officials from the national corn growers association and the national cattlemen association said their groups oppose any 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers but when asked if his association were forced to choose between ten pct cut in target prices or 92 program larry johnson of the corn growers said they would agree to 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels

more grain certificates needed study says more generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the certificate program to have its full effect on commodities according to study by sparks commodities inc the agriculture department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in two third certificate one third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989 carroll brunthaver president of sparks commodities told house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly 50 50 split between cash and certificates brunthaver said the sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season zero certificate case where no certificate program was assumed and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings the study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11 pct usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 when grain usage under certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct for the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case the sparks study said that billion dlrs or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs the study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined the sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash

dutch grain levy test case to start in april large dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as test case on the way the ec grain co responsibility levy is applied spokesman for dutch grain and feed trade association het comite told reuters het comite has been co ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and since december has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the business appeal court in the hague the basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country het comite has obtained temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying full guilder amount to the dutch grain commodity board the spokesman said het comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the business administration court in the hague oral proceedings are to begin on april 10 the spokesman said het comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged because the bill the firm received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from wide variety of origins the name of the company is not being made public the administration court is not expected to make final ruling on the case in the near future the het comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the appeal court in luxembourg and as result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved meanwhile the actions by dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek complete review in brussels of the way in which the levy is collected the spokesman said het comite as member of fefac the association of european animal feed manufacturers is also party to actions protesting the whole levy in the luxembourg appeal court

soviets outline 1988 economic targets the soviet union outlined its economic targets for 1988 on monday stressing the need to improve standards in the country sluggish engineering industry planning chief nikolai talyzin told the supreme soviet industrial output should rise by pct in 1988 up from planned pct in 1987 it rose pct in jan sept 1987 talyzin said national income the nearest soviet equivalent to gross national product should rise by pct against planned pct this year gross national product measures the output of country goods and services he said the kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus planned 232 mln this year moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986 kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev has described machine builing as sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the soviet union is to compete effectively on world markets certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine building industry the economy is not receiving considerable amount of the equipment that it requires said talyzin who heads the state planning committee gosplan soviet data show the machine building industry which makes machine tools instruments and other engineering goods increased output by pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year however this was far below the pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988 talyzin said the ruling politburo had concluded at recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to large extent on conserving resources better large scale measures are planned to save resources he said finance minister boris gostev told the supreme soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs the same figure as was announced last year western governments view official soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated but say the real figure is hard to calculate because soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy talyzin said the kremlin also decided to increase spending next year on medical services education pensions and social insurance schemes

certificates to provide wheat corn supplies from april through december 1986 the commodity credit corporation ccc issued 85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about billion had not been exchanged by january 1987 the agriculture department said the department said an additional billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during january august 1987 these certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year the department said in summary of its agricultural outlook report freeing of stocks through certificates is making grain more competitive on world markets it said the department said last summer for example certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn this helped increase marketable supplies so farm level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel somewhat lower than they would have otherwise the lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels it said the department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half billion dlrs from 1986 25 billion dlrs during 1988 and 1989 the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980 will reverse if current policy remains in force annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year record by more than eight billion dlrs it said the department said the president budget proposals for 1988 1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs in 1987 foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to pct the same as in 1986 but above the pct average of 1980 86 it said partially because of this improvement export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years the department said

ec commission set to detail grain import plan the ec commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the ec in fulfilment of its agreement with the united states commission sources said under the accord reached following complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of spanish ec membership the ec will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum year up to end of 1990 all this produce will be imported into spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other ec countries the sources said it was possible that the spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year as it was rather late to make other arrangements they added that the choice for future years appears to lie between system of regular tenders and the setting of daily special levy applicable to spanish imports there will initially be no tax on re exports of maize and sorghum from spain to other ec countries although such tax could be imposed later the sources added

australian wheat area to fall forecaster says australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10 40 mln hectares in 1987 88 from 11 72 mln sown in 1986 87 australian wheat forecasters pty ltd awf said in its first preliminary crop forecast but there was no reason to expect australian production in 1987 88 would be less than the 16 mln tonnes of last year the private forecaster said as crops in new south wales and queensland suffered from poor yields last season most of the fall in plantings was expected in western australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said the main reason for low western australia estimate was poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures but in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and june is not less than average awf said although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct awf said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops the lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and oats is cause for concern if those crops are to comprise high proportion of growers income awf said awf state area forecasts in mln hectares with 1986 87 production in mln tonnes are as follows crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year area crop 1987 88 1986 87 1986 87 queensland 82 82 95 07 17 40 victoria 53 63 25 australia 45 64 30 australia 53 46 60

house 92 farm proposal seen sparking debate house agriculture committee meeting later today to draft disaster aid bill is expected to spark debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 92 or de coupling provision to cover feedgrains and those who oppose 92 or want it severely limited congressional sources said the disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for one year 92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop the bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments the administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year it is difficult to tell in what form the 92 provision will emerge from the committee the sources said proponents of an expansion of 92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such bill ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs opposition to reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill committee staffers said the 92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 est conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week such delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 92 program since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends march 30 farmers are now making their planting decisions so something has to be done quickly if 92 program is to be implemented an agriculture department source said an expansion of 92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week subcommittee hearing on the bill with subcommittee chairman dan glickman kan saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary major commodity groups including the national corn growers the american farm bureau and the national cattlemen association have voiced strong opposition to 92 but proponents of an expanded 92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers so it should be extended to other crops there will be difficulty in limiting 92 to wheat said gene moos aide to house majority leader tom foley wash projected cost savings in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 92 application moos said rep charles stenholm tex may be planning to introduce bill to restrict 92 to only 1987 crop wheat with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill stenholm bill is not rejection of 92 only of the timing congressional staff member said rep arland stangeland minn is reported to have an amendment to expand the 92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains

feedgrain 92 supporters evaluate position advocates of 92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if disaster aid bill before the house agriculture committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat congressional sources said the disaster aid bill introduced by rep glenn english okla sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement 92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat an agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat but supporters of 92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled down version would not be equitable for farmers unless the english bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat it is more than simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally they said if the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat then supporters of 92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week sources said english has agreed to support an amendment by rep charles stenholm tex to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only but whether he would also back further reduction is unclear agricultural aides to english said the congressman first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers however if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat then english might consider an even greater cutback in the bill they said under 92 plan farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments rep arlan stangeland minn and harold volkmer mo have both expressed interest in expanding the english bill to include 92 program for feedgrains an aide said stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill but to be fair to all crops only small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land economists said opponents to 92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the house agriculture committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such program

soviet union to import more grain in 86 87 usda the agriculture department increased its estimate of 1986 87 grain purchases by the soviet union to 28 mln tonnes up two mln tonnes from last month in its monthly report on the soviet grain situation the usda said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month usda said the increased purchasing is somewhat surprising because of recent higher soviet crop estimates all of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn usda said of the 28 mln tonnes total 15 mln tonnes will be wheat 12 mln tonnes coarse grains and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses usda said usda noted that the soviet winter grain crop suffered through severe winter and spring field work has been delayed the severe winter is believed to have resulted in above average winter kill usda said some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the soviet union has been actively buying grain recently usda said moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986 87 including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain
usda raises soviet grain import estimate the agriculture department increased its estimate of soviet 1986 87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month projection of 23 mln tonnes in its monthly ussr grain situation and outlook usda said the increase reflected the return of the soviet union to the corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers ussr wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes up one mln from last month estimate and 700 000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985 86 figure soviet grain for feed use was estimated at record 129 mln tonnes record or near record livestock inventories along with dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage and cold winter have increased feed demand usda said ussr meat and egg production in january rose only slightly from the previous january level while milk production increased by nearly six pct unusually cold weather in january and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did year earlier usda said
cost of pik certificates to be eyed by congress congress eager to find budget savings launches review of the agriculture department generic commodity certificate program tomorrow amid signs usda and the general accounting office gao are at odds over how much the program has cost taxpayers the gao concluded in preliminary report last week that payment in kind or pik certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays administration officials who asked not to be identified said usda officials however took issue with the report saying it did not take into account storage handling and transport savings that accrue to the government the gao then decided to re examine the costs sources said the issue is an important one because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as means of cutting spending agriculture under secretary daniel amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley are set to testify before the senate agriculture committee tomorrow amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays and that savings to the commodity credit corp ccc almost equal costs department sources said usda estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage it was unclear whether the gao congress investigative arm would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs reagan administration sources said the gao is expected to point out that use of payment in kind pik certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold the testimony by amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit including considering limits on the use of pik certificates the ccc issues dollar denominated pik certificates or certs as partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for ccc commodities or cash between april and december 1986 ccc issued billion dlrs worth of certificates according to usda up to another billion dlrs worth could be issued between january and august 1987 according to usda certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate eliminating this practice called pik and roll would save the government billion dlrs between 1988 92 according to the congressional budget office cbo that estimate according to cbo official was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments the senate and house budget committees are known to be considering curbs on pik and roll transactions among other savings alternatives the gao last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs or between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays one administration official said however the gao has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on usda criticism department officials said the broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of crop year usda economic research service for example has found that between june and august last year the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel between september and november however certificates had only marginal impact on corn prices according to the ers study obtained by reuters

economic spotlight asian droughts three geographically diverse droughts in asia are being linked by some scientists to reintensification of the complex and little understood el nino weather pattern lt accu weather inc commercial weather forecasting service said rice and wheat farmers in china wheat and sugarcane growers in australia and tea planters in sri lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said wen wei po hong kong daily with close peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added rainfall in the key farming provinces of henan and sichuan was 70 pct below average during february the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said the dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last march and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added this has resulted in reduced hydro electric power causing shortages to industry and households the upper reaches of the yangtze are at their lowest levels in century causing many ships to run aground wen wei po said unusually high temperatures have also been reported across china media reports said the people daily said sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees celsius higher than average since early february the new china news agency said the average december temperature in harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last december and 14 degrees higher than december 1984 severe drought is affecting about one third of sri lanka and threatens to reduce the country tea crop ministry of plantation industries officials told reuters in australia concern is growing about below average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the queensland coast and in western australia wheat belt local meteorological bureau officials said for many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose major threat the prospect of dry autumn winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as el nino they said although meteorologists are cautious about linking the asia pacific region disrupted weather patterns to any single cause el nino role is being closely studied they said accu weather inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each el nino event was unique the el nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982 83 it said el nino spanish for christ child because it appears around christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the indonesian archipelago to the coast of peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the peru current and returns across the pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said the winds strengthened by el nino pump effect raise the sea level off australia and indonesia they said when the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends surge of warmer water back across the pacific where it collides with the cold seas off peru they said one effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain bearing clouds away from australia and indonesia into the pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns the prospects for an end to the droughts vary accu weather said china where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the may september rains it said the may september rains normally provide the drought striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall in australia areas of queensland coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end in sri lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year the year secondary rains usually occur between april and june although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
china to import more grain in 1987 china grain imports will rise in 1987 because of serious drought and increasing demand but will be not be as large as in the past chinese officials and japanese traders told reuters they said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow return to large scale imports which peaked at 16 15 mln tonnes in 1982 an agricultural official of the shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year against 73 mln in 1986 and 97 mln in 1985 officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of poor harvest and rising domestic demand but remained below exports which rose to 42 mln tonnes from 33 mln in 1985 china is short of foreign exchange the shanghai official said we cannot rely on imports even at current low world prices only if there is major disaster will we become major importer japanese trader in peking said chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption at current prices china loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs the trader said the people daily said last saturday serious drought is affecting 13 mln hectares of arable land which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year level the paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture especially grain making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986 all areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area especially of corn sweet potatoes paddy rice and high yield cash crops it said it added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought since january the press has devoted much attention to grain stressing that growth in output is vital to china economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low officials in east china have repeatedly said stable grain production is key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output the shanghai official said that in one suburb 10 pct of the pre tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture he said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70 000 workers available to help farmers chu jinfeng an official of fengbing county outside shanghai said factory workers get 60 yuan month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits pan huashan an official of the agricultural department of zhejiang province said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province in addition we are setting up grain production bases raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials roads and other infrastructure he said the shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time or let other family members farm it in some cases they lease the land to grain farmers the china daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000 it said growing grain should be made profitable the advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption only this will boost enthusiasm it said

shultz ussr trip fuels talk of eep wheat offer speculation the united states will offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union appears to have reached new level of intensity in the run up to secretary of state george shultz visit later this month to moscow rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi annual grain talks in february moscow decision at that time to reenter the corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects shultz is set to arrive in moscow april 13 shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of wheat subsidy offer under the export enhancement program eep coupled with the announcement of his visit to moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as clear signal that the reagan administration was preparing an offer administration officials in and out of the agriculture department have been extremely tight lipped about the prospects of subsidy offer but usda officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not done deal is live possibility prominent grain trade representatives many of whom asked not to be identified continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent others who one month ago claimed deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out rep pat roberts kan yesterday went so far as to predict subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks aides to roberts said he had spoken to republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials richard fritz director of international marketing at wheat associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer washington made peking earlier this year when usda approved subsidies to china of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat some grain trade representatives say four mln tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more soviet purchases of corn and open the door to sales of soybeans as ever one of the crucial sticking points in wheat deal would appear to be price last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the soviets subsidized wheat but were embarrassed when moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 dlr per tonne subsidy still left wheat prices far above world market prices the administration decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent shultz from saying the soviets were chortling because washington was offering soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to housewives the conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the grain belt would favor subsidy offer in addition the ussr has made it clear it would consider buying wheat if it were priced more competitively however observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the white house had decided to expand the export enhancement program to include not only the soviets but also much broader list of countries instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the soviets that last minute change of heart adds measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the soviet union

markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today turmoil in the financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar wake is evidence of major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar decline as the cure all for the trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker often repeated warnings about the risks of dollar collapse volcker been saying for long time that dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he got it said david jones economist at aubrey lanston and co inc the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to 1987 high of 432 20 70 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by 33 points to 2339 norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it difficult to stop there stark possibility that you could get destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 47 marks and 264 yen in february 1985 could turn into nightmare we re still more or less on track for hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to recession the stock market reaction today and its sharp drop on march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast drop to about 125 yen marris felt that major impetus for the dollar latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is substantial increase in the discount rate and corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968 69 will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said

analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise economists said that they doubt the federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period wednesday borrowings were billion dlrs as federal funds averaged high 45 pct one could make case that the fed is firming but it probably isn said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two weeks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two week period included quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn quite make it said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets fed spokesman told press press conference today that the fed had no large net one day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday still mccarthy said it may have had cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around billion dlrs they put wednesday overnight system repos at approximately billion dlrs it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time said larry leuzzi of warburg and co inc citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said mccarthy of merrill lynch he said the dollar staged precipitous drop as new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to weekly average fed funds rate between six and pct this is about where the rate has been since early november not so sure that the fed is engineering tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said sullivan of dean witter if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 25 to 35 pct from six to 10 pct previously

wojnilower sees drop in interest rates the federal reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth first boston corp managing director albert wojnilower said as much as the fed would like to take tough line against inflation it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national economic policy on selected occasions when the dollar seems steady and because the trade deficit is not responding the united states decided to push germany and japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth the federal reserve will do its part by moving rates down wojnilower said in report justifiably not anticipating either recession or seriously higher interest rates securities market participants have seen little to fear wojnilower said he said last week hiccup in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by japanese window dressing for march 31 end of fiscal year accounts wojnilower said the probably enjoyed above average economic growth in the first quarter however the pick up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about pct he said
lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages more lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the they were the mainstay of the business in the up until only few years ago but in the early 1980s interest rates soared lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts as result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds we very much have the example of the thrifts in mind said spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year the 100 mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just few days according to spokeswoman everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumption that conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years

no reason to cut rates bundesbank schlesinger bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that further cut in interest rates was needed the economy is picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview concerned by the first quarter downturn the has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in 1986 year on year growth was thus about two pct he estimated that economic growth for the year as whole would probably be between one and two pct it is not question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the bundesbank three to six pct target he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows heavy inflows particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation boosted domestic money supply there is still certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be little bit reversed schlesinger said major reason for the inflows was the market conviction that the mark was headed higher as we can see from the market expectations for further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished schlesinger said the recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said asked if central banks might act to prevent sharp dollar rise as the did in march when the dollar rose above 87 marks he said this would depend on the circumstances at midday here the dollar stood at 8340 45 marks central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but cannot give any answer how they would react schelsinger said one has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding it is not only our own case it is also the american case he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now but it wouldn be good to have short term fluctuations he said let us wait and see it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in very short period which was little bit of shock than the level of rates as such schlesinger said the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had favourable impact on west german inflation down year although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for possible eventual resurgence of inflation the above target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the bundesbank council schlesigner said but he added don see any great pressure to go away from it

german government needs seen raising bond yields increased federal government borrowing needs and growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say at the moment we have sideways movement in the short term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners one portfolio manager for large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried 10 year maturity coupon of six pct and price of 100 to yield 97 pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had pct coupon priced at 99 pct for yield of 75 pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said it isn more it just the size of each bond which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than 18 billion marks the government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986 but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26 billion the sources said this indicated move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government tax reduction program would also reduce income next year the problem here will be the tax reform the portfolio manager said he added that the government cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise total 43 billion marks through the issue of fixed rate medium term kassenobligation notes finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only net 22 billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect would expect the efforts for further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank public authority bond yield calculation falling to 64 pct on friday from 66 week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark the demand wasn so good dealer for german bank in london said the dollar recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently some dealers said

fed drafts currency rate swap risk gauge the federal reserve board voted unanimously to propose formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with new capital standard for banks that takes into account the riskiness of bank loans and other assets fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the bank of england the fed set 60 day period for public comment on the plan the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments previously the fed jan proposed series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off balance sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each level of risk that would establish bank minimum capital needs the additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for bank current exposure for given asset and the potential future exposure the current exposure would be measured by the mark to market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the bank of england and banking regulators future exposure would rise over the life of the asset the fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity they ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities they cautioned the fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of banks to compete in world financial markets however the staff concluded the credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations the fed proposal would exempt all but the 20 25 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges governor martha seger said she was concerned that japan was not involved in the effort to draft new capital rules

housing data fail to clarify economic path surprisingly strong housing statistics for february cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates but economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months and after steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom housing starts rose pct in february to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 851 mln units from 804 mln in january it was the highest pace for starts since april 1986 the rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed pct to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 764 mln units after dropping 11 52 pct to 690 mln in january february weather is usually more adverse for home building because of seasonal factors it difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road said allan leslie of discount corp the housing report is seasonally weighted to compensate for weather related setbacks as result milder temperatures inflate the statistics economists said that low mortgage rates also were spur to building last month but several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring early summer builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying let do it now said mark obrinsky of the league of savings institutions in washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building but obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the economy he expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 50 pct fixed rate effective in february last november fixed rate mortgages were about 10 30 pct as expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single family sector the multi family area which typically represents rental units remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective january single family starts rose at pct annual pace to 317 mln units multi family fell pct to 534 000 rate strength in the single family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job but we re probably not looking at great deal of growth potential said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets mccarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in employment industrial output and retail sales in february may cause some observers to start waving four pct gnp banners for the first quarter gross national product grew pct in the fourth quarter but mccarthy who still expects first quarter real gnp to come in at an annual rate of pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future the big story is the inventory re building that going on now not all of which is intentional he said for example automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of mln units in february compared with domestic car sales of mln thus while inventories could contribute to gnp in the first quarter they may result in scaled back production and weaker growth in the second he said if most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter agreed allan leslie of discount corp he is still evaluating first quarter gnp prospects federal reserve chairman paul volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed at the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second cautioned joe plocek of mccarthy crisanti and maffei inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct

lawson happy with sterling backs latest rate cut chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today announcement of further half point cut in british bank base lending rates to 10 pct however he said he wanted to see gradual approach to declines in domestic interest rates although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly he told briefing of economic journalists that don think we should rush anything lawson stressed the themes of gradualism and steadiness as economic policy lawson acknowledged that today fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987 88 unveiled yesterday to parliament and which set lower target for the key public sector borrowing requirement psbr of pct of gdp lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines were perfectly consistent with monetary conditions now in britain he supported that by saying the narrow m0 money supply aggregate was safely inside its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986 87 and 1987 88 in his budget lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling m3 turning to the question of britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system ems lawson repeated that it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election he said britain was keeping the subject of full ems membership under constant review but he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government prime minister margaret thatcher late last year said decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the economy but she later said such move depended on other ems countries scrapping residual capital controls although lawson denounced what he said was the current wave of election fever in britain he added it is more likely that there will be an election this year than not he said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air ideally we the government should have full term but events could force premature poll lawson said the government which has been in power since 1979 must call an election by june 1988 speculation is rising for either june or an early autumn election political sources said the decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987 88 was the right balance economically and politically he said lawson decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two pence surprised many analysts who had predicted that with treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move but it was being praised today by political analysts as shrewd move which while advancing towards that aim could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the psbr had undershot his original assumption of billion stg for 1986 87 by some three billion stg returning to changing levels of interest rates lawson stressed that they are not an objective for the government they are an instrument of policy consequently the treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels he said but there may be interest rate consequences from changes in the level of government borrowing he added lawson said he did not think that the relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in britain he said conditions created by london role as leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in britain lawson said first control of credit in britain rested on interest rates alone due to the freedom of its financial markets he said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition labour party thirdly he said we do not have as long track record of low inflation as did the japan and west germany lawson foresaw london becoming the world pre eminent financial centre because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than new york or tokyo

imf urges belgium to make further spending cuts the belgian government which introduced large scale public spending reductions last year has been told by an international monetary fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988 the suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual imf consultations with belgium on its economic policy copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet the imf team also urges belgium to adopt firm interest rate policy with particular emphasis on long term rates the team report to the government praises last year spending cuts which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs and says 1986 saw the belgian economy perform better on broader basis than at any time so far in the 1980s however it adds that with lower inflation stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of gnp target the government has set itself for 1989 the government net financing requirement was 11 pct of gnp in 1986 the report says the most that can be afforded over the next few years is zero growth of real non interest expenditure of general government it says there is need for revision of the belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to gnp ratio before this is possible because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience for tax reductions we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988 the report adds the imf urges strong interest rate policy to signal the government determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation it says firmer long term rates would slow private net long term capital outflows which increased strongly in 1986 it also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non residents of government bond issues in belgian francs

bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of imports and sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said reduction in the current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in 1986 koehler said if further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the when selecting monetary policy instruments central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

bank of england pressure holds base rates this week bank of england resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct but at cost of threatening the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson policy stated at the end of the paris group of six meeting last month that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels market sources said since then the pound has risen to 71 pct on its closing trade weighted index up from 69 pct imediately after the paris meeting and up on the day today peak at 72 pct was its highest since august 19 treasury spokesman said lawson had said he neither wanted substantial rise or fall in sterling the question is therefore how large rise he is ready to see before acting paul temperton chief economist at merrill lynch europe ltd estimated that the government wanted to see the trade weighted index about 72 73 pct even after this action over the last few weeks sterling only just within striking distance of that range he said other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area however they said lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term despite the risk of loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports if the bank of england keeps the interest rates as they are what to stop it going higher said john cox executive director of ebc amro bank ltd major operator on the london foreign exchange market cox estimates that the bank of england has been active selling sterling over the past few days despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention and this has helped keep it below 60 dlrs the pound rose to 5870 dlrs from 5764 yesterday and 5400 february 23 the day after the paris meeting but cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels he warned the bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat if rates don come down the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling he said most dealers agree there is good deal of hot money being invested in sterling money simply attracted by high overnight or one week rates which could flow out at equally short notice however the authorities will hope that at least proportion of the buying reflects long term investment the last thing they want to do is reduce them rates and have to jack them back up again said richard jeffrey economist at brokerage house hoare govett ltd he said half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling at least in the near term however most analysts are still looking for full point about march 17 budget day the bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the budget said temperton the budget is widely forecast to be vote winner in the run up to general election the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets lawson wants to delay cut in base rates until the budget he wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut said ian harwood economist at warburg securities the equities arm of mercury international group speculation clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today there was excitement fall in the weekly treasury bill rate to pct from 10 pct last friday might mean the bank had changed its mind this followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 pct on the discount houses yesterday and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct early last october however with this bill rate pertaining to three months money banking sources said the market could not take the cut as guide to the bank intentions on short term rates

trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cut the release of february trade data showing that the current account surplus was provisional 376 mln stg up from 73 mln surplus in january has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates analysts said market forecasts had been for worse outcome with expectations of deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply narrower than january 527 mln deficit the figures are unreservedly good chase manhattan securities economist andrew wroblewski said sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing weaker morning trend to stand at 72 pct of its trade weighted index against basket of currencies at midday unchanged from yesterday close but points above the 1100 gmt level the market had feared that deteriorating non oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling which has been the motor behind the recent fall in interest rates money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to pct from the present 10 pct was really on the cards but sentiment now looks to have turned about again there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson forecast of 1987 current account deficit of billion stg will be exceeded said wroblewski seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in february to 16 billion stg from 73 billion in january exports rose to record 93 billion from 20 billion however chris tinker analyst at brokers phillips and drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months he forecast the chancellor budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods however ian harwood economist at warburg securities said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 75 billion stg he said news of strong growth in exports of non oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the confederation of british industry the growth in imports appears to be flattening even if january bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import intensive stock building among manufactureres harwood said government bonds or gilts surged by more than point on the better than expected news as earlier worries about the figures evaporated sterling peaked at high of 6075 dlrs before settling to steady 6050 dlrs about 1300 gmt nearly cent higher than the european low of 5960 however analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to newspaper opinion poll showing that the conservative government support was slipping the marplan poll published in today showed conservative support had fallen to 36 pct from 38 pct last month while the alliance of liberals and social democrats had rallied to 31 pct from 21 pct to run neck and neck with the labour party whose own support fell from 38 pct the poll was taken after the budget which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent political observers said another regular poll is due tomorrow and eonomists warn that today improved sentiment could be dented if support for prime minister margaret thatcher slips again this upsetting of the markets political perceptions which are all but discounting conservative victory in the upcoming general election made them more sensitive to the trade data harwood said the news did come as very very substantial relief he said however on the interest rate front economists caution that lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall they noted lawson had already got an inflation reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed

german financial policy makers in rare dissension karl otto poehl head of west germany central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank independence but rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued statement rebutting poehl criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through particularly difficult time there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october that the government was planning 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said poehl is in minority in his own house said commerzbank pfister poehl is in dilemma he must follow policy that is not entirely his own said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow revival of the 1986 war of words between the and west germany in which officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with local political row which has turned into the country worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out row in the northern state of schleswig holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl cdu led coalition government gave poehl another eight year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank independence of government chrobok said

new bank rules tougher than needed dealers say and bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the bank of england and the federal reserve board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine while no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement separately the isda estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding kenneth mccormick co chairman of the international swap dealers association isda and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc said that the association has no comment and will study the proposals what they are proposing is really double counting patrick de saint aignan managing director of swaps for morgan stanley and co said instead he argues banks should either be required to hold percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of counterparty default the potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said director at one merchant bank what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he added adds title first paragraph dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in japan will have competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements federal reserve board governor martha seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the fed said she is concerned that japan was not involved in the effort to draft new capital rules dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to single counterparty against each other the paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk furthermore the paper said if netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design one problem is that there has never been major default in the swaps market so we don know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official

national savings move points to lower rates interest rates look set to move lower even after monday half point cut in bank base rates to 10 pct analysts said citing as evidence the suspension of british national savings issue yesterday the department of national savings effectively treasury department unit yesterday suspended its 32nd issue launched in october and paying high tax free pct on five year private investments between 25 and 000 stg spokesman said the suspension was just reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market the move was followed by surprise sell out within minutes today of bank of england one billion stg tap issue the second such issue in as many weeks analysts noted they said the near instant sale of the entire new gilts issue for which the bank of england had required high 40 pct downpayment was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later the sale of the tranche of pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact with the bellwether three month interbank rate down point at 10 pct it coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four year highs against the dollar that government stock disappeared very quickly indeed said stephen lewis head of economic research at stockbrokers phillips and drew it is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further at least by half point immediately after the budget on march 17 and some people hope for more stockbrokers james capel said in comment the move by the national savings department was of considerable significance it said the real message is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises building societies have said drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half point to give rise to reduction in mortgage lending rates lewis of phillips and drew said he too believed the national savings issue suspension may reflect new treasury policy to point building societies towards mortgage rate cut national savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late building society income has been depressed in recent months he said he and other analysts said chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep lid on inflation underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in britain than in most other western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year pct emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices lewis said one point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in britain by about pct but lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from national savings which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts the chancellor need not be worried about losing some psbr funding from national savings but he must be taking the building societies criticism to heart it looks like the national savings move reflects this one senior dealer said savings department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation saying the suspension of the issue was merely reaction to the recent fall in interest rates which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market we are not politically motivated funding was just becoming too expensive and we don need all that money he told reuters adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past when offered interest rates were above or below market rates he said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending march 31 in the first 10 months of fiscal 1986 national saving contribution to government funding totalled 72 billion stg compared with 01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year official figures show figures for february out on monday are expected to show further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg pushing the total for 11 months above target government officials said

base rates will fall again soon say analysts today modest half point cut in bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the bank of england determination to maintain cautious monetary stance but financial markets appear set to force its hand analysts said they said further half point cut in base rates to pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed further half point soon if markets remain buoyant earlier markets were bracing for one point cut in rates after yesterday budget set sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg sterling money market rates moved lower again with the key three month interbank rate down to pct at the start of business from 11 16 16 yesterday and sterling rallied to four year highs against the dollar in very active trading government bond prices also surged on the budget with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly year but today smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now analysts said money market rates recovered up to point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to near halt analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow leading to higher gilt prices exchange rate advances and lower money market rates today cut was slightly disappointing said bill martin chief economist at stockbrokers phillips and drew the bank of england is taking very cautious line to temper the markets first rush of blood to the head after the budget analysts said the bank move today to lend two week cash to discount houses at lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time the analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term sharp rises in the pound value could be checked initially through bank of england intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again the market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being said midland bank treasury economist david simmonds but am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two cents this week from around 60 dlrs forcing rate cut by friday robin marshall chief economist at chase manhattan securities said there is another half point to come in the near term this week or next week at the latest we see whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks analysts stressed that apart from prestige britain had very little to gain from sharp rise in sterling exchange rate martin of phillips and drew said the dampening effect of sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately analysts said the budget featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances had improved the chances of re election for the conservative government and probably advanced the election date one must be held before june 1988 combined with overall good prospects for the economy this was likely to fuel foreign rush on sterling denominated assets pushing the pound value well above unofficial targets with mark denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and dull economic outlook chase marshall said sterling is simply the best game in town especially after the budget and demand will remain strong

german bond yields seen falling in near term west german bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month paris pact extend to keeping down european interest rates banking economists said but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany economy they said the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in and foreign interest rates salomon bros inc said in recent study it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was major factor in the dollar fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline it not taboo peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank average yield of public paper is already nearing last year low last week yields fell to around 50 pct not far from the 1986 low of 35 pct posted in mid april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer term paper such move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet demands for faster west german growth this move may force interest rates up by creating revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo institut said in newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn tax reform package the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by billion marks to 14 billion west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed large 21 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14 billion in fourth quarter 1985 the federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such credit in the 1985 quarter

bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by news conference at around 1030 gmt but bundesbank officials noted that news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in 50 70 pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at minimum bid rate of 50 pct allocating funds at 55 pct they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted diplomatic gesture before next week venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further the bonn government will be in very weak position in venice because they can risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst hutmann bethmann chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy but don expect any convincing measures he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 60 70 pct from 75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june 15 two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 55 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 50 pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than 55 that would not represent tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes

treasury baker under fire for wall street drop as official washington sought to restore investor confidence after monday wall street collapse treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis baker weekend blast at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretary statements helped spur wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy lawson told london television interviewer tuesday think the scale of the stock fall was very great that think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic it was dispute that should never have happened he added although baker appeared to patch over the rift at hastily called meeting with west german officials monday he still faced storm of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday baker cut short long planned trip to scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis said one analyst of baker weekend remarks his timing could not have been worse one government bond salesman in new york said he actually thought that yelling at the germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work that doesn show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship however some analysts said west germany stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced baker hand on the surface baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it unsettling of financial markets it was west german policy said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was little like killing the messenger he said after monday talks the and west german governments made it clear that the louvre currency accord pieced together in paris in february was still in effect wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be prelude to hyper inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s analysts believe monday wall street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values treasury sources said that baker already unhappy about bonn refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite he felt that the recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion growing economy has been serving as huge market for debtor country exports moreover baker the consummate politician was worried that the republican party might face next year presidential election with its main showpiece vibrant economy badly tarnished rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off economic growth that has already slowed to tepid pct annual rate there no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there ll be serious price to pay economically former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in television interview in many ways the official response was mild washington was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat with president reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact for all of this it seems unlikely that baker status in washington will diminish because of the market fall asked by reporters if somebody head should roll because of the wall street retreat texas democratic senator lloyd bentsen said with some irony oh think it much too late to be doing that you have an administration that taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and retire to the living room to take nap you just can do that
stoltenberg says criticism not one way street finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said he was surprised by recent criticism of west german economic policies voiced by treasury secretary james baker but added that the criticism was not purely one sided stoltenberg told the west german trade and industry association diht that before meeting with baker on monday there had been surprising notes of criticism from the united states he added criticism is not one way street he did not elaborate but bonn has often called on the to reduce its federal budget deficit over the weekend baker had criticised west german economic policies saying that rises in domestic interest rates here were not in the spirit of last february louvre pact to stabilise currencies stoltenberg told the diht that his meeting on monday with baker had resolved differences between the two countries at news conference earlier on tuesday stoltenberg had declined to comment specifically on baker criticisms but he had said that after three hours of discussions on monday one remark or another has been clarified

belgium cuts treasury certificate rates the belgian national bank cut interest rates on one two and three month treasury certificates to 30 pct from 40 pct effective immediately the bank said in telex message the bank last adjusted its short term treasury certificate rates on march 23 when it also reduced rates for all three periods by 10 points national bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates the spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the move would herald reduction in discount rate which currently stands at eight pct when the bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is discussed next wednesday the discount rate generally moves in tandem with the three month treasury certificate rate however there is no formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following the march 23 changes
interest rates hurt may housing sales sales of new single family homes tumbled 14 pct in may from april levels because of higher mortgage interest rates analysts said there should be another month or two of very weak new home sales but with interest rates stabilizing sale of new homes should become more stable by mid summer said economist lawrence chimerine of wharton econometrics inc the drop in may to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616 000 units was the largest since january 1982 the commerce department said interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at about 08 pct in march and rose to about 10 pct in april according to stephen roach economist at morgan stanley the effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out of the market he and others said the rates moved very suddenly and were certainly unexpected by homebuyers said cynthia latta an economist with data resources they were so startled they wanted to hold back and see what would happen the drop in sales of new single family home sales was sharper than expected some economists said we fully expected decline but the extent was more than we anticipated said james christian chief economist for the league of savings institutions christian said there was sharp rise in may in sales of existing homes which are generally less expensive than new homes latta of data resources said strong sales of new condominiums in the northeast and on the west coast were reflected in sales of existing but not new homes christian of the league of savings institutions said underlying housing demand remains strong think the market is going to stabilize and give us good second half others were less optimistic however we clearly won have boom in new home sales but don think this is the start of collapse in single family housing said chimerine of wharton eugene sherman chief economist of the federal home loan bank of new york said the lower sales level will be maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates there won be much specific improvement in coming months

credit policy seen steady despite bank data an unexpectedly heavy billion stg surge in september sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the bank of england towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state economists said an acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending in the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure noted peter spencer economist with credit suisse first boston after an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data which compared won stg august rise government bonds gilts soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities equity markets dropped sharply on the news touching day low of 766 on the ftse 100 index after the data before staging recovery sterling held its buoyant tone throughout money market rates in similarly calm response resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than token blip as the figures came out noting that such huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct with the financial markets doing what they re doing that the last thing the bank of england would want to do spencer said the monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm the authorities are unlikely to put rates up said kevin boakes chief economist at greenwell montagu gilt edged boakes pointed to rise in the narrow money measure m0 to pct year on year from august pct growth which he said must cause some concern at the treasury but the fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is rather encouraging sign noted paul temperton economist with merrill lynch capital markets he pointed to fall in the year on year growth rate of the m3 broad money aggregate to 19 pct in september from august 22 pct it was concern about credit growth which prompted the bank of england to engineer one point rise in bank base rates to 10 pct in early august caution endorsed subsequently by news of massive billion stg july rise in bank lending temperton noted that particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of asset markets housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour he said in the light of the precipitous falls on equity markets in the past few days there will almost certainly be straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales temperton said almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues he added think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is thing of the past we are talking about very serious panic and flight to quality spencer said treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information not just the bank lending adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing figures from the banking information service showed personal sector lending by clearing banks rose by 66 billion stg in september after 978 mln stg august rise much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments
analysts see slow move to higher prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve policy intentions economists said based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said paul mcculley of hutton and co citibank surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is strong chance of prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12 pct after fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting pct prime rate since last august 26 27 when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august 20 the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be split prime for while with some posting pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today coupon pass said joseph liro of warburg and co in move that came day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with 153 basis point average in 1986 reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present clear need for prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today prime rate rise may have been less response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds traded between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates but consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar then banks would lift prime rates quickly

urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan the is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy reagan administration official said the official comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october 1985 washington outlined debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played key role in developing the debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for new loan of 15 billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was suitable way to go fine don think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it quite unique and don think it something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall 27 billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation development until now unacceptable to the banks it no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines

bank of england resists pressure for rate cut the bank of england again fought against money and bond market pressure for pre budget interest rate cut leaving the pound to take the strain with further rise in its trade weighted index to six month high it closed at its best level since september 12 at 71 pct of its 1975 value on the index as foreign investors continued to buy into currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short term capital gains dealers said meanwhile opinion is divided over whether the bank can stop cut before budget day march 17 and why it should want to the bank latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon when it lent to the discount houses at penal rate of 11 pct to relieve money market shortage they re really making the discount houses suffer said stephen lewis economist at brokerage house phillips and drew eleven and three quarters pct is way above money market rates this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday so buyers came strongly into the pound the pound surged to high of 5798 808 dlrs at the london close up from the previous finish at 5650 60 and 8900 60 marks up from 8720 50 if this pressure keeps up there is possibility that rates could drop before the budget said jeremy hale economist at finance house goldman sachs international corp some gilt traders are forecasting half point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow however analysts said the bank of england will need to be convinced that the present rise is fundamental re rating rather than result of short term speculative gains there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious said peter fellner economist at brokers james capel and co markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of conservative party victory in any early general election and disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to hold back could lead to decline in the pound and setback for bonds fellner said an election could be delayed until mid 1988 but most forecasts say it will be this year others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or change of fortune for the dollar however analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set the timing of cut than holding out against one altogether the authorities traditionally prefer single sustainable rate move one way or the other to half points here and there some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long term capital coming into the london market notably from japan they argue that the pound is being perceived as safer bet than the dollar given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in washington the bank may want to see another few points on the trade weighted index before the budget argued lewis but by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of england he added the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for rate move before the budget but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders meanwhile analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front today figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was billion stg this was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with surplus of billion stg in 1985 fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets pause but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals the guessing game over the timing of cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets privately some bank officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this week but at least one bank says rise is possible tomorrow if move comes before march 17 forecasts are for half point cut with another half or full point about budget day

analysts say budget points to base rate cuts chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts if slightly lacking in excitement cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow with most forecasts predicting half point fall follow up half point cut is anticipated next week worthy but boring would probably sum it up peter fellner economist at stockbrokers james capel and co said it was very very prudent fiscal budget richard jeffrey of brokers hoare govett said it was well balanced budget within the confines of the government philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat most analysts said the budget was very sound on the fiscal side but offered nothing new on monetary policy as was widely expected lawson split his fiscal adjustment between trimming the 1987 88 psbr target to billion stg from billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct the target for the narrow measure of money supply m0 was kept unchangd at two to six pct while the target for the broad sterling m3 aggregate was dropped both jeffrey and fellner said the budget clears the way for half point fall in base rates tomorrow but the authorities are unlikely to sanction larger cut immediately many analysts and currency dealers have forecast full one point cut tomorrow the bank of england will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later jeffrey said though he added further half point cut was quite possible in the near future the main worry from today speech is the outlook for inflation given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it scrimgeour vickers economist richard holt said holt noted the rather loose inflation forecast of pct at end 1987 and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern higher psbr target could be preferable in the long term he said although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation the budget will inspire lot of short term confidence but it was not good budget for inflation he said jeffrey said he would have liked lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build up but overall was not too concerned about revival of inflation fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the leading edge of monetary policy but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front he said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness most analysts agreed lawson had bolstered the credibility of the budget by adopting realistic forecasts raising the forecast for the current account deficit from to billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets which are already discounting that amount jeffrey said that the billion stg psbr target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986 87 which is now also forecast to be billion stg but analysts said the budget speech did not give any clear cut indication about the timing of the general election which has to be held before june 1988 some believe it signals poll this june noting that the benefits such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco become available immediately but others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it james capel fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no chickens coming home to roost richard jeffrey who favours the likelihood of june election said it was important the chancellor had not gone for budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory nevertheless he said it was likely to result in boost to the conservative party pre election popularity
tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have major deflationary impact on the real economy they said although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise fears of rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said but today stock market collapse prices fell nearly 15 pct means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely rumoured discount rate increase senior government economist suggested that both the and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices they need to support the stock and security markets he said but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was few months ago with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said there will be some impact on the real economy but it won be that big said another individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said paradoxically it is the pick up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said that will at least take couple of days if not weeks he said

dollar value appropriate bundesbank official says the dollar is near appropriate levels against european currencies and the yen and further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth top bundesbank official said board member leonhard gleske also told forex association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in medium term perspective he said the recent paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the group of five and canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability the paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level at present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies and the yen gleske said he said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as canada korea taiwan and hong kong and further falls there may still be necessary but further dollar depreciation against major european currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said in fact further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers gleske said first in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as japan and west germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses second in the united states it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits gleske said gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them for instance the reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones if target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities commenting on the paris currency accord gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained these chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot he said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said

dollar seen falling unless japan spurs economy underlying dollar sentiment is bearish and operators may push the currency to new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150 00 yen and to fall even below that level senior dealer at one leading bank said the dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 151 50 yen six major industrial countries agreed at meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but drastic fall is unlikely because of fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of treasury securities needed to finance the deficit dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further steps to weaken the dollar under the paris accord tokyo promised package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of five pct sales tax and the government has only slim chance of producing meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said if no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said the factors affecting the currency have not changed since before the paris accord they added underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to still sluggish economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by brazil unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the reagan administration as result of the iran contra arms scandal said senior dealer at leading trust bank there is possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140 00 yen by the end of this year said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president yukuo takahashi but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention dealers said there were widespread rumours that the federal reserve telephoned some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 87 marks the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it neared 60 dlrs on wednesday they said but other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as chance to sell dollars however first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager hiroshi mochizuki said the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march other dealers said the seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on march 31 because weak dollar would give japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of treasury securities monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said

currency intervention timing crucial analysts the dollar recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said central banks may succeed in slowing trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said jim neill financial markets economist with marine midland banks inc the importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for week through open market intervention after citibank raised its prime rate by quarter point to pct the first change in the rate since last august the dollar started to advance and reached high in tokyo of 147 50 yen up two yen from tuesday new york low by contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the bank of japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of march but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing 40 year low monday of 144 70 yen some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just temporary battle to prop up the dollar the market is wary of being caught wrong footed by central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized they ve lost their credibility the market feels it can take on the central banks and win said michael snow head of treasury operations at union bank of switzerland in new york the relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the september 22 1985 plaza accord then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances now there is no such consensus the market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while japan is resisting in bid to protect its export industries for its part the united states is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the february paris agreement of the group of five plus canada to foster stability dealers say specifically they said the fed dollar buying intervention has been half hearted designed more as political gesture to japan than to strike fear into the markets it been pro forma intervention said francoise soares kemp chief corporate trader at credit lyonnais because of this discord and the market momentum for lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail it going to take lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation there have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it late last decade during the presidency of jimmy carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to record low of 70 marks analysts said snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely don think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market trading volume in london new york and tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs day according to joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the group of thirty private research group there are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide bank of japan sources told reuters in tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered in this era of financial liberalization it almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of japan one senior official in tokyo said

new bank rules tougher than needed dealers say and bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the bank of england and the federal reserve board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine while no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement separately the isda estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding kenneth mccormick co chairman of the international swap dealers association isda and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc said that the association has no comment and will study the proposals what they are proposing is really double counting patrick de saint aignan managing director of swaps for morgan stanley and co said instead he argues banks should either be required to hold percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of counterparty default the potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said director at one merchant bank what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he added adds title first paragraph dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in japan will have competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements federal reserve board governor martha seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the fed said she is concerned that japan was not involved in the effort to draft new capital rules dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to single counterparty against each other the paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk furthermore the paper said if netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design one problem is that there has never been major default in the swaps market so we don know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official

bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by news conference at around 1030 gmt but bundesbank officials noted that news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in 50 70 pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at minimum bid rate of 50 pct allocating funds at 55 pct they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted diplomatic gesture before next week venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further the bonn government will be in very weak position in venice because they can risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst hutmann bethmann chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy but don expect any convincing measures he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 60 70 pct from 75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june 15 two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 55 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 50 pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than 55 that would not represent tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes

sprinkel urges greater growth in japan europe beryl sprinkel chairman of the president council of economic advisors said stronger domestic demand growth in japan and western europe is needed to help stimulate exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation he told the futures industry association sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in japan and europe has been one of the weakest in the post war period stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery he said asked if japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners he said recent figures showed japan economy grew by about pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 not enough to sustain employment growth however sprinkel said japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies including tax reform suspect there will be further moves he said sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in government spending and for resistance to tax increases reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform he said adding that vote to increase to government expenditures is vote against tax reform sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the trade balance appeared to have abated however he said that sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable as it risks inflation in the united states and recession abroad am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 he said improvements in the trade balance he said will come about largely from swing in manufactures trade and present serious adjustment problems for trading partners western europe where manufactures output and employment have been weak promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the trade balance sprinkel said he defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them
new currency problem seen among europe japan the highly visible drama involving the yen sharp rise against the dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies thus creating new set of exchange rate distortions japanese and european research officials said the officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five industrial nations told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan trade axis into japan european community ec axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september 1985 new york plaza pact between the japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely you have to look at the dollar peak compared with now and that was well before plaza he said on february 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 263 15 yen on september 20 the friday before plaza it was 242 since then despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down yet the ecu is now around 173 yen the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story the european currencies are moving back up against the yen the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing in 1986 japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen this gave japan 16 billion dlr trade surplus last january japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the against about third in recent years trade with the in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the it is europe that is laying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from small base compared with total japan trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than firms factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries but therefore japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said azusa hayashi director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry if you want my objective view don expect drastic improvement in our trade imbalance last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said reuter

treasury mulford reaffirms agreement treasury assistant secretary david mulford reaffirmed backing for the paris agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels in testimony prepared for delivery before senate banking subcommittee mulford said there was broad recognition in paris that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects but he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation we have refrained from establishing system of target zones or ranges mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments he said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures he said accordingly mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive commenting on the trade deficit mulford reiterated the treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months but he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from west germany and japan to stimulate their economies and by efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance competitiveness he also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate

lawson happy with sterling backs latest rate cut chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today announcement of further half point cut in british bank base lending rates to 10 pct however he said he wanted to see gradual approach to declines in domestic interest rates although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly he told briefing of economic journalists that don think we should rush anything lawson stressed the themes of gradualism and steadiness as economic policy lawson acknowledged that today fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987 88 unveiled yesterday to parliament and which set lower target for the key public sector borrowing requirement psbr of pct of gdp lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines were perfectly consistent with monetary conditions now in britain he supported that by saying the narrow m0 money supply aggregate was safely inside its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986 87 and 1987 88 in his budget lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling m3 turning to the question of britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system ems lawson repeated that it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election he said britain was keeping the subject of full ems membership under constant review but he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government prime minister margaret thatcher late last year said decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the economy but she later said such move depended on other ems countries scrapping residual capital controls although lawson denounced what he said was the current wave of election fever in britain he added it is more likely that there will be an election this year than not he said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air ideally we the government should have full term but events could force premature poll lawson said the government which has been in power since 1979 must call an election by june 1988 speculation is rising for either june or an early autumn election political sources said the decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987 88 was the right balance economically and politically he said lawson decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two pence surprised many analysts who had predicted that with treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move but it was being praised today by political analysts as shrewd move which while advancing towards that aim could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the psbr had undershot his original assumption of billion stg for 1986 87 by some three billion stg returning to changing levels of interest rates lawson stressed that they are not an objective for the government they are an instrument of policy consequently the treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels he said but there may be interest rate consequences from changes in the level of government borrowing he added lawson said he did not think that the relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in britain he said conditions created by london role as leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in britain lawson said first control of credit in britain rested on interest rates alone due to the freedom of its financial markets he said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition labour party thirdly he said we do not have as long track record of low inflation as did the japan and west germany lawson foresaw london becoming the world pre eminent financial centre because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than new york or tokyo

nigeria changes auction rules to defend the naira nigeria central bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as means of defending the naira currency which has depreciated steadily the bank said in statement that from april banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as presently at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction this should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september 26 at last week session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is central part of nigeria structural adjustment program which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in black africa the program involves setting realistic exchange rate for the naira which was over valued for many years liberalising imports boosting agriculture removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy the world bank has played prominent part in designing this dramatic blue print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards ishrat husain the world bank representative in nigeria said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as whole and the foreign exchange auctions so far so good he told meeting of bankers in lagos adding that only members of nigeria import dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect he said bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last september

economic spotlight dutch exchange rate policy recent slackness on dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the west german mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy while agreeing with the bank commitment to defend the guilder strongly some bankers want the bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the european monetary system ems roelof nelissen chairman of amsterdam rotterdam bank nv amro said the central bank policy was overcautious would like to suggest that the bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the ems nelissen said at the presentation of amro 1986 annual report last week within the ems the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110 1675 and 115 235 guilders per 100 the central bank maintains stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113 00 guilders per 100 it regards stable exchange rate as its main target using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate the preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the netherlands critics say the bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short rabobank nederland said in its latest economic bulletin by maintaining the 113 00 limit the central bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level if it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain amro nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the dutch capital market large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder mark exchange rate he added unlike amro algemene bank nederland nv abn says this is price the dutch have to pay it fully agrees with the central bank policy director general julien geertsema told reuters noting 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the ems hurt confidence in the dutch currency it is pity we need such wide interest rate difference between west germany to maintain the exchange rate he added interest rate differentials between west germany and the netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries as the economic performance of the two does not differ much economists said data on 1986 capital flows between west germany and the netherlands have not yet been released but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the dutch german chamber of commerce earlier this month economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates west germany is the netherlands largest single trading partner taking 28 pct of dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986 central bureau of statistics figures show at the moment the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around pct while the same deposits in guilders have rate of around 16 pct amro bank argues that the dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987 contrasting with slight inflation in west germany in the netherlands the cost of living is expected to decrease by pct at gnp growth rate of two pct the dutch central planning agency said in its 1987 forecast last month german gnp is seen rising by two to pct but with inflation between zero and pct according to most german forecasts but despite this upward push on real dutch rates money dealers do not expect the central bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the bundesbank following the west german interest rate cuts on january 22 the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the bank to follow suit unconditionally they said the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies the central bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow the european monetary system is not only relationship between the guilder and the mark many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of third currency central bank vice director jan hendrik du marchie sarvaas said if we allowed the guilder to become little cheaper the markets would start to believe it was weak we don want that we want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark he said

baker stoltenberg meeting soothes markets news of meeting between treasury secretary james baker and west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg on monday soothed currency markets allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day losses dealers said news of the meeting which took place in frankfurt in great secrecy came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by baker of west german monetary policy which had provoked fears that the louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy the dollar reacted immediately to the news rising over two pfennigs in after hours new york trading dealers there said the announcement of the meeting also attended by bundesbank president karl otto poehl was made simultaneously in bonn and washington timed for after the closure of new york markets baker stoltenberg and poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the february louvre accord finance ministry spokesman in bonn said the dollar rose to 7970 90 marks from new york close of 7730 40 it had closed there on friday at 7975 85 marks the dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to baker criticism of rising west german interest rates and stock markets crashed worldwide baker had said that west germany was apparently breaching the louvre accord under the accord leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability with the surplus countries west germany and japan stimulating their economies and the promising to cut its budget deficit west german government sources said rising west german money market rates could not be seen as breach of the louvre pact they were rather direct reaction to higher interest rates in the united states bond yields have been rising since may on inflationary fears and in early september the fed raised the discount rate to 00 pct from 50 german yields have also risen over this period but less markedly and since late september the bundesbank has nudged up short term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts its principal instrument for steering the money market the allocation rate on the last facility was 85 pct compared with 60 pct this was partly due to west germany inability to uncouple itself from interest rate trends but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth which raised fears of domestically produced inflation bank economists said this monetary tightening reflected switch from the pragmatic line pursued by bundesbank president karl otto poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally to the more cautious approach of vice president helmut schlesinger in an apparent gesture to baker coinciding with his visit the bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning dealers said this was clearly move to appease anger over the most recent west german interest rate rises they the bundesbank just don want to come too much under american fire said chris zwermann currency adviser at swiss bank corp here it seems to me that this is the bundesbank beating quite significant retreat from its position added giles keating economist at credit suisse first boston ltd in london the significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the bundesbank next tender for securities repurchase pact on tuesday and its result on wednesday money market economists said today injection of liquidity shows that the bundesbank does not want further strong rise in the tender allocation rate which is likely to turn out at between 80 and 90 pct little changed from the 85 pct on the last facility the bundesbank and finance ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place although the finance ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week earlier on monday the finance ministry spokesman asked to comment on the apparent german clash over the louvre accord went no further than quoting stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue the spokesman said he believed baker had already left west germany for sweden on monday this week he is also due to visit denmark and belgium
think it is possible that there may be scope for further reduction in interest rates in germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such move was likely he made no mention of japanese interest rates lawson said the should embark on gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years he said the february 22 louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks and he was content with sterling exchange rate pointing to the record billion stg rise in may currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing very full part ourselves we have been intervening to very much greater extent than we had done hitherto lawson said there was risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro economic commitments underlying the accord certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris in this respect he said the budget deficit was very important noting the 000 billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports supply side measures are critical there is specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said lawson doubted that tokyo partners would indulge in japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years japan more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990 he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries on debt lawson said he expected three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub saharan countries to make progress in venice the plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions first it is blow for realism second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp he said banks should follow bank of england recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions they have done it to some extent they need to do it more lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit there is consensus which we have to push further

markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today turmoil in the financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar wake is evidence of major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar decline as the cure all for the trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker often repeated warnings about the risks of dollar collapse volcker been saying for long time that dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he got it said david jones economist at aubrey lanston and co inc the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to 1987 high of 432 20 70 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by 33 points to 2339 norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it difficult to stop there stark possibility that you could get destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 47 marks and 264 yen in february 1985 could turn into nightmare we re still more or less on track for hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to recession the stock market reaction today and its sharp drop on march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast drop to about 125 yen marris felt that major impetus for the dollar latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is substantial increase in the discount rate and corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968 69 will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said

german financial policy makers in rare dissension karl otto poehl head of west germany central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank independence but rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued statement rebutting poehl criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through particularly difficult time there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october that the government was planning 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said poehl is in minority in his own house said commerzbank pfister poehl is in dilemma he must follow policy that is not entirely his own said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow revival of the 1986 war of words between the and west germany in which officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with local political row which has turned into the country worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out row in the northern state of schleswig holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl cdu led coalition government gave poehl another eight year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank independence of government chrobok said

leading industrial nations to meet in april leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability but officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month talks seem likely to build on that stability reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels that is in fact what has happened since paris monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short term policy objectives instead they have focused on medium term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings the official refused to comment however on whether the agreement included secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year on february 22 the united states japan west germany france britain and canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions given commitments by washington to cut its budget deficit and by toyko and bonn to boost economic growth the shake up would strengthen the position in future international talks think these changes will strengthen the president hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the congress and the better off we are in international fora said the official an administration economic policymaker so it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives but the official also said the administration would resist calls for tax increase to cut the budget deficit target europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability currency analysts believe the paris agreement set secret short term target ranges for their currencies with specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention according to market sources the ranges agreed were 60 to 90 marks to the dollar and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar there is no official confirmation that specific bands were set although the agreement used the term ranges for the first time in an international economic agreement the paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels last week dealers said the federal reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark which had breached 86 to the dollar british authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling strength international monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers who will review market performance and their own economic prospects will reassemble again in washington just before the april policymaking meeting of the international monetary fund the sources said italy which refused to join the paris pact was invited back by treasury secretary james baker since paris there are signs west german growth is slowing while officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank central bank president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates if the fed was ready to follow suit reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank if there is such provision it is private and if talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the trade deficit remains stubbornly high further coordinated action could be on the april agenda
banker predicts further dollar fall this year leading banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge american trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels kurt viermetz worldwide treasurer of lt morgan guaranty trust co told arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in deficits on lasting basis speaking at the 14th annual congress of the interarab cambist association viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered cannot see any chance for real turnaround rise in the dollar viermetz said believe there is room for further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 the united states west germany japan france great britain and canada agreed in paris in late february to stabilise major currencies around current levels the accord came after months of transatlantic argument with tokyo and bonn claiming washington policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for west german and japanese exporters the paris accord also brought pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by meeting in new york in september 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances but viermetz said morgan guaranty economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates and continued sluggish growth in west germany and japan the trade deficit would improve only temporarily he said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990 it would be back around 160 billion dlrs this is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in washington he said viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the paris accord struck when the dollar was trading at about 83 marks and 152 50 yen immediately before the historic 1985 new york agreement or plaza accord the dollar had been trading at 84 marks and 240 yen viermetz said he believed major nations in paris wanted to see the dollar hold within loose range of 75 to 90 marks and 145 to 155 yen with any attempt to push the currency lower being countered by central bank intervention the dollar ended in new york yesterday at 147 15 25 yen its lowest level against the japanese currency in roughly 40 years it closed at 8160 70 marks viermetz also said he did not see the federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar but at the same time worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of rise above pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world the middle east foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the arab world and arab banks in european and financial centres formal discussions which end today have also centred on the role of arab banks in world financial markets with bankers urging them to adapt to new global trend towards securitisation of business hikmat nashashibi president of the arab bankers association said arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking

fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for long time the commodity concept is part of growing search for system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early 1970s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for monetary conference to work out new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller basket of say 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and commodity price index can be calculated on virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on world wide basis so that an index has relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities
japan carefully considering money policy sumita bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar asked if the bank of japan will consider further cut in its discount rate he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy he told lower house budget committee in parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by japan since the beginning of last year japan must now be especially careful about flare up in inflation with money supply growth accelerating he said sumita said the central bank would continue to make judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside japan asked if the september 1985 plaza agreement was failure because the dollar had fallen too far sumita said he still thought the pact was good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar but the plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar fall he said the dollar steep fall stems from the market belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand he said

required last week the white house imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain japanese electronic goods after tokyo failed to adhere to semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries the shift in strategy in part designed to appease mounting congressional anger over japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the paris agreement to stabilize currencies and news that japan earned record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of officials nonetheless officials

economies and the united states cutting its budget deficit the three nations joined by france britain and canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances but analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply lower dollar rather than stable one markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures including budget deficit cuts agreed by congress and the white house will be carried out nonetheless the dollar sharp fall has not undermined cooperation economic policymaker said the accord was on track and tokyo and bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the paris accord calls for international monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although japan is an obvious exception everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments but last week the bank of japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs another monetary source said japan was upset with america half hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the paris accord outright the source close to the top levels of japanese economic policymaking said japan understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck the source said tokyo was extremely worried by washington use of the exchange rate to change japanese policies it was pointed reminder to japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar fall against the yen by departing last sunday from the language of the paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels baker triggered run

meeting here where the six will be joined by italy will be status report japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and germany will report on its plans maybe there need to move

bundesbank retains money supply policy bundesbank council member lothar mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates mueller said in an article for the boersen zeitung financial daily that monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy the article followed international press speculation that the bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy mueller member of the bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in bavaria noted that the bundesbank decision in january to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy he explained mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation the bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down lower money market rates achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials also encouraged investors to re invest funds parked in liquid accounts mueller said the measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path he said finally of course and there is no need to keep this quiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months he added all in all the bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the january discount rate cut despite suppositions to the contrary mueller said keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather than growth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non banks mueller said now that west germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue specific mark dollar exchange rate in any case the exchange rate partly depends on currency and budgetary policy and the economy he said but an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the bundesbank even interest rates are not in the centre of the bundesbank considerations but reflect competition and other market conditions mueller said cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock the bundesbank main money supply indicator this does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the bundesbank instruments mueller said the less dependent non banks are on bank credits the harder it is to steer money supply this has increasingly been the case recently because non banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports if the bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows he said mueller said growth in money supply was still too high in the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct down from 10 pct in the previous quarter the growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth pointing to the success of the current policy he said but high monetary stocks can be warning sign and there should be no change in priorities monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy nothing else he said

new currency problem seen among europe japan the highly visible drama involving the yen sharp rise against the dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies thus creating new set of exchange rate distortions japanese and european research officials said the officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five industrial nations told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan trade axis into japan european community ec axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september 1985 new york plaza pact between the japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely you have to look at the dollar peak compared with now and that was well before plaza he said on february 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 263 15 yen on september 20 the friday before plaza it was 242 since then despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down yet the ecu is now around 173 yen the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story the european currencies are moving back up against the yen the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing in 1986 japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen this gave japan 16 billion dlr trade surplus last january japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the against about third in recent years trade with the in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the it is europe that is laying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from small base compared with total japan trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than firms factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries but therefore japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said azusa hayashi director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry if you want my objective view don expect drastic improvement in our trade imbalance last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said

jobs data said to rule out fed tightening steep drop in goods producing jobs detracted from march non farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the federal reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar economists said march non farm payroll employment rose 164 000 less than the gain of 220 000 to 290 000 the financial markets expected manufacturing employment fell 25 000 compared with february 50 000 gain while march construction employment dropped 45 000 after being unchanged in february the momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter said stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc this sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters the fed will view this as caution flag on the economy he said they will not ease as long the dollar is weak but clearly they can tighten david wyss of data resources inc said that the downward revision in february non farm payroll employment to 236 000 from 337 000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected while wyss left his first quarter forecast of real gross national product growth at pct he said the march jobs data suggested downward revision in his second quarter growth forecast to pct from pct bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc said the average monthly gain in non farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237 000 compared with 254 000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 there momentum in first quarter labor force activity but less than assumed he said gains in goods producing jobs were subdued at best this rules out any possibilty of the fed tightening for exchange related purposes in march the average workweek fell back to its january level of 34 hours from 35 hours in february manufacturing hours also fell back to their january level totalling 40 hours in march compared with 41 hours in february the commerce department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in march was concentrated in automobile electrical and electronic manufacturing robert brusca of nikko securities international said that 13 000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs economists said that build up in auto inventories resulting from steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first quarter gnp accounts roach said he expects first quarter gnp to rise two pct to be followed by gain of pct at best in the second and third quarters he said the march drop in industrial activity is reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to gnp economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for march they expect only marginal gains if not small declines for these indicators compared with february increases of pct in industrial production and pct in personal income steve slifer of lehman government securities said the drop in march construction employment may also signal drop in march housing starts which rose pct in february to 851 million units at an annual rate from 804 million units in january the rate of unemployment fell to pct its lowest level since march 1980 from pct in february but wyss pointed out that this resulted from drop in the labor force which fell to 119 mln in march from 119 35 mln in february this just means that there were fewer people looking for work so the drop in unemployment doesn mean much he said he said the latest employment report will not concern the fed because it does points to gnp growth in the first half of pct but it does suggest they can afford to tighten to quickly either the statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated march labor force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in january and february slifer said but are consistent with his forecast of pct first quarter gnp growth economic growth remains sluggish but silfer does not think that the federal open market committee changed policy at their meeting this week at some point they will be more inclined to ease he said for the time being however the march employment report increases the likelihood they won tighten regardless of the dollar

poehl warns against further dollar fall bundesbank president karl otto poehl said weaker dollar would be risky and further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit he said the united states could face vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful he said he said he shared some of the concern about japan trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said this was remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said but he said there was still danger that the correction of the dollar value could overshoot

treasury mulford reaffirms agreement treasury assistant secretary david mulford reaffirmed backing for the paris agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels in testimony prepared for delivery before senate banking subcommittee mulford said there was broad recognition in paris that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects but he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation we have refrained from establishing system of target zones or ranges mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments he said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures he said accordingly mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive commenting on the trade deficit mulford reiterated the treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months but he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from west germany and japan to stimulate their economies and by efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance competitiveness he also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate

france has little room for manoeuvre oecd says french industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy the organisation for economic cooperation and development said with gross domestic product likely to grow only pct this year the same rate as last year unemployment could climb to 11 pct of the workforce by mid 1988 from its present 10 pct it said in an annual review of the french economy the report said the french economy was increasingly ill adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets france poor export performance reflects geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average and substantial loss of market share in the past 18 months it said pointing to likely widening of the french trade deficit to around billion dlrs this year from billion in 1986 it warned that further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries this could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non oecd area which accounts for almost quarter of french exports it said until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to slowdown in inflation to around two pct annual rate this year and early next the oecd said written mainly in december last year the report took no account of rise in oil prices early in 1987 and pct surge in january consumer prices caused partly by the government deregulation of service sector tariffs we took bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one oecd official commented oecd officials said the january data and rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs barrel average assumed in the report indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around or three pct the government last week revised its forecast up to between and pct from two pct against last year pct but the oecd backed the government view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival west germany could fall to just one pct this year it said on the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits for the disinflationary process to continue and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability it is essential that wage restraint continue it said

economic spotlight deficit with nics the trade deficit with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the in 1986 will get bigger this time next year the will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects reduction in japan trade surplus this year but manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in 1986 the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit for 1986 the trade gap with taiwan rose to 15 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13 billion in 1985 while the bilateral trade deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary data show that the growth trend is continuing the trade shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up 24 pct from year earlier the gap with korea was 700 mln dlrs up 24 pct from year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain trade surplus for three to five years as way to cut its 44 billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on 700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan trade surplus with the will fall in 1987 the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to 675 000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985 the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the takes 90 pct of korea computer products exports 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan overall trade surplus to grow to 18 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15 billion last year and korea to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the lot of korea and taiwan exports to the have been at japan expense said richard koss at general motors corp february paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with sizeable lag economists say the has not said how much it thinks the taiwan and korea currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the dollar has risen about 15 pct since september 1985 while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel wendt and so far pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far protectionism will get given the administration free trade stance it hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end and then the question is will it have teeth one economist said

yeutter sees gatt consensus on farm trade reform trade representative clayton yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest gatt round was launched in punta del este uruguay last september yeutter said at least people seem to be going down the same road but how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely there seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there yeutter said however the hard work is still to come with couple of years of tough negotiations ahead he said it is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy he said he said the long term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas this would help agriculture because some its inefficient non productive segments would stop operating he said individual segments in many countries may lose in the process but it should result in more rational system of world wide production within 10 or 15 years he said it is important that the agriculture negotiations reach relatively early conclusion because the is spending 26 billion dlrs year and the european community probably more than that which is an ineffective use of financial resources he said asked about the prospect of priority for agriculture in the negotiations he said one has to be politically realistic if there is any chance of getting it agricultural trade reform done in two to three years it going to have to be as part of larger package
poehl warns against further dollar fall bundesbank president karl otto poehl said weaker dollar would be risky and further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit he said the united states could face vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful he said he said he shared some of the concern about japan trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said this was remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said but he said there was still danger that the correction of the dollar value could overshoot

japan says oecd study on subsidies still ongoing japanese agriculture ministry officials said study of agriculture subsidies by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd is still under way and will be completed sometime next month the officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said japan would comment on the final results reuter report from washington yesterday said the study has found that japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies the study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said oecd directors are expected to approve the release at meeting in mid may one agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979 81 japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said the study is unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography the source said he said it is highly likely that the final study will show japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world this would increase foreign pressure to open japan farm market further but this would have little impact on japan agriculture policy he said without giving further details main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the united states and the european community but japan is major importer he said

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only shot across japan bow but also sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide officials said but robert crandall trade specialist at brookings institution think tank said shot across their bow can often result in shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the officials said the 100 pct tariffs reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the trade gap last year was record 169 billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said don think it makes lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don want trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said don think it makes lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don want trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated

german current account surplus widens in february west germany current account surplus widened to provisional billion marks in february from slightly downwards revised billion in january spokeswoman for the federal statistics office said the trade surplus in february widened to provisional 10 billion marks from billion in january she added the statistics office had originally put the january current account surplus at billion marks the february trade surplus was well up on the 84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986 but the current account surplus was down slightly from the 85 billion surplus recorded in february 1986 statistics office statement said the widening of the february current account surplus compared with january was due to seasonal factors neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted february imports measured in terms of value totalled 32 11 billion marks decline of 10 pct against february 1986 but rise of pct against january exports in february also in value terms totalled 42 56 billion marks pct less than in february 1986 but up 13 pct compared with january the statistics office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in february but for comparison purposes it noted that in january the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year on year while the average value of exports had declined by only pct within the current account the services account had 300 mln marks deficit supplementary trade items 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted billion mark deficit taking the first two months of 1987 together imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62 billion marks compared with year earlier the value of exports totalled 80 billion marks decline of pct against the same months of 1986 the resulting trade surplus of 17 billion marks for january february compares with cumulative surplus of 14 billion marks in the year ago period the cumulative current account surplus for january and february 1987 totalled 11 billion marks against 11 billion marks year earlier the statistics office said bank economists said the rise in the february trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors the federal statistics office said earlier this week that february import prices fell pct against january while export prices were unchanged the rise in the nominal figures masks lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least said an economist he said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks an economist at the bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft bfg in frankfurt said two month comparison of trade figures gave more accurate picture of west germany trade position he noted the 17 billion mark surplus for january and february together was lower than the 21 billion mark surplus posted in november and december the trend is clearly lower he said this economist who declined to be named said the february rise was also partly explained by special factors in january when there had been number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather both of which hindered trade
belgian says ec would react to textile bill belgian foreign trade minister herman de croo said if congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the european community ec could react was to retaliate de croo said at news conference if you limit textile imports you will re orient textiles to europe and that he said would trigger ec taxes on goods congress passed textile bill two years ago but it was vetoed by president reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation trading partners similar bill has been introducted this year in congress with bigger democratic majority and with president weakened by the iran scandal de croo here for talks with administration officials and congressmen said if textile bill passed the only way we could react would be retaliation and it would cause more retaliation which is not good way to deal with problems he said if textile bill was enacted we will impose taxes on lot of american products he said it would be stupid we have to avoid that he said congressmen seem upset mosty with japan because of its massive trade suprlus with the united states and not with ec nations but ec nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of asian textiles de croo also criticized the way officials try to solve ec trade issues saying each time we come in contact it conflict contact the clouts are coming fom the west he said it then is crisis atmosphere with officials cross the atlantic and dramatized with headlines this is not the way to work in serious way between two big powers de croo said
economy shows promising signs of growth the economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say some of the slowness experienced in the october december period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in january slowed business and consumer spending but some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook the commerce department reported today that new orders for durable goods in february jumped by billion dlrs six pct rise to 101 billion dlrs even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose healthy pct the agency said the february numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct the january february employment statistics suggest the gross national product will show healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said lyle gramley an economist with the mortgage bankers association the jobless rate in february and january was pct the lowest rate since march 1980 the number of new non farm jobs rose by 337 000 in february after 319 000 gain in january and 225 000 december increase the government said the employment data suggests gnp annual growth rate of about three to 25 pct in the first quarter said gramley much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter gramley said he expects slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending he also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi family housing units fidelity bank senior economist mickey levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue levy predicts gnp will grow at scant pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show brisk pct annual rate in the third quarter the key to both forecasts is marked improvement in the trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar value over the last year and half the improvement will be gradual and long lasting levy predicted most of it will be through import reduction but at least one third will be due to rise in product exports as the prices of goods become more attractive overseas the reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the economy will grow by respectable pct for the year compared with pct rate last year as part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the has been pressing west germany and japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the and others officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the united states whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries the economy provided them with giant market for their goods giving them way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt the government last week said the economy grew at modest pct annual rate during the fourth quarter there were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the united states and those shipped abroad the report showed rising volume of exports corresponding to decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 while fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped healthy pct during the period the government said it also reported that inflation as measured by the gnp price deflator remained in check growing moderate pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years the government also reported that consumer spending key element of the five year economic recovery jumped pct in february after falling two pct in january the federal reserve board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the economy was showing signs of recovery in its latest report on current economic conditions the fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except dallas where orders remained sluggish chase econometrics chairman lawrence chimerine said the pick up in the manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar value he said he does not foresee major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either he said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power that pattern is starting and will continue for number of years chimerine said he sees economic growth hovering around modest two pct level for the next few years
tense trade ties to dominate ec talks tense trade relations with the and japan and concern about the foreign impact of proposed european community ec tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by ec foreign ministers here tomorrow ec diplomats said britain demanded the early debate on the ec executive commission proposal to impose hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off proposal it sees as extremely damaging to ec foreign relations the proposal was the most controversial part of reform package due to be discussed by ec farm ministers later this month of the ec common agricultural policy widely seen as the root cause of the ec persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners the proposal is described by its promoters as stabilisation program which would penalise new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production rather than straight forward tax they say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by fall in ec output but would also save the ec some two billion european currency units over two billion dlrs in farm costs it has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters led by the united states the diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world ranging from senegal malaysia and indonesia to brazil argentina canada iceland and norway the proposal had little chance of approval by ec governments with west germany as strongly opposed to it as britain and denmark the netherlands and portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom even mediterranean countries such as italy france and greece which backed similar proposals in the past did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected but the diplomats said protectionist lobby in the and elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti ec action and the foreign ministers debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the ec and deprive its oponents of this argument the ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the congress for range of protecionist legislation such as bill that would curb ec textile exports the diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back commission warning to washington that such bill if enacted would provoke swift ec retaliation

trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cut the release of february trade data showing that the current account surplus was provisional 376 mln stg up from 73 mln surplus in january has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates analysts said market forecasts had been for worse outcome with expectations of deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply narrower than january 527 mln deficit the figures are unreservedly good chase manhattan securities economist andrew wroblewski said sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing weaker morning trend to stand at 72 pct of its trade weighted index against basket of currencies at midday unchanged from yesterday close but points above the 1100 gmt level the market had feared that deteriorating non oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling which has been the motor behind the recent fall in interest rates money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to pct from the present 10 pct was really on the cards but sentiment now looks to have turned about again there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson forecast of 1987 current account deficit of billion stg will be exceeded said wroblewski seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in february to 16 billion stg from 73 billion in january exports rose to record 93 billion from 20 billion however chris tinker analyst at brokers phillips and drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months he forecast the chancellor budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods however ian harwood economist at warburg securities said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 75 billion stg he said news of strong growth in exports of non oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the confederation of british industry the growth in imports appears to be flattening even if january bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import intensive stock building among manufactureres harwood said government bonds or gilts surged by more than point on the better than expected news as earlier worries about the figures evaporated sterling peaked at high of 6075 dlrs before settling to steady 6050 dlrs about 1300 gmt nearly cent higher than the european low of 5960 however analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to newspaper opinion poll showing that the conservative government support was slipping the marplan poll published in today showed conservative support had fallen to 36 pct from 38 pct last month while the alliance of liberals and social democrats had rallied to 31 pct from 21 pct to run neck and neck with the labour party whose own support fell from 38 pct the poll was taken after the budget which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent political observers said another regular poll is due tomorrow and eonomists warn that today improved sentiment could be dented if support for prime minister margaret thatcher slips again this upsetting of the markets political perceptions which are all but discounting conservative victory in the upcoming general election made them more sensitive to the trade data harwood said the news did come as very very substantial relief he said however on the interest rate front economists caution that lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall they noted lawson had already got an inflation reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed

economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland economy and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided very useful excuse for under achieving they did have bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as theoretical projection based on high point which has no real scientific evaluation foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the in the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln as credits ran out poland has dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it an illusion based on misunderstanding of western economy there limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today reality describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has hard currency debt of 33 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the japan and europe would also hamper poland efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has moral right to assistance from the which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but western economist said the argument that sanctions were unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in short time and not without cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the had particular opportunity to play part in the cooperative policy of poland partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play more positive role as major superpower the united states can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which western nations were prepared to cooperate

study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation swelling trade deficit government study said in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the economy it said the 218 page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to record 166 billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said although each industry competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s it also said it found fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries lack of investment in industry declining research and development in industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the 1970s and antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit

in strategy in part designed to appease mounting congressional anger over japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the paris agreement to stabilize currencies and news that japan earned record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of officials nonetheless officials see signs of improvement in the deficit be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one in paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality the agreement envisages those fundamentals to include japan and west germany stimulating their economies and the united states cutting its budget deficit the three nations joined by france britain and canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances but analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply lower dollar rather than stable one markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures including budget deficit cuts agreed by congress and the white house will be carried out nonetheless the dollar sharp fall has not undermined cooperation economic policymaker said the accord was on track and tokyo and bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the paris accord calls for international monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although japan is an obvious exception everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments but last week the bank of japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in

on the dollar later in the week mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on japan and west germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth but officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the paris agreement there realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said while no one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another official said the officials said the meeting here where the six will be joined by italy will be status report japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and germany will report on its plans maybe there need to move faster one source said mulford told congress last week the paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several months this would buy time for japan and west germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the trade deficit his comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the japanese and german trade surpluses and the trade deficit

brazil debt seen partner to hard sell tactics brazil recent announcement of suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 the developing world most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said that sounds like reasonable strategy but there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation aldo roldan vice president for international services at chase econometrics said roldan told reuters that brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates roldan said the chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for country like brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had total value of around 23 billion dlrs but he added they are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels analysts said key factor in brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with vengeance negotiations between international coffee organization ico members to re establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence brazil would not tolerate change in ico regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said the dealer who declined to be named said brazil wanted to preserve its market share at the end of the talks he said brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy brazilian sales the dealer said if they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach dollar ninety or eighty cents he said new york coffee futures for may delivery settled 29 cents lower thursday at 104 68 cents lb while more distant deliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit president of the brazilian coffee institute jorio dauster told press conference in rio de janeiro today that brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ico talks on export quotas many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped up brazilian marketing efforts they will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to richard loewy analyst for prudential bache securities inc loewy believes the foreign debt problem good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the brazil soybean crop brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can afford to store the crops he said the chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large south american crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields we are going to see very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our exports loewy said tommy eshleman economist for the american soybean association asa said this year brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 13 mln last year marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the crop to bad growing weather another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of reduction in the government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral eshleman said he said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan we re getting into period when they brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export eshleman said but he added it will be while before exports fall to below 10 mln bushels week from around 20 mln bushels currently jose melicias from the research department of drexel burnham lambert said brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation he said the debt situation was major consideration the brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added asked if return to an inflationary environment in brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops melicias said it would not make big difference on other commodity markets brazil selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital brazil is faced with poor 1986 87 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said the country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said brazil other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so don think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said if they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they can afford to do that she added

oecd trade growth seen slowing in 1987 the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the economist intelligence unit eiu said the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to pct this year compared with pct growth forecast in december it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences and japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to pct from pct in december and to pct from three pct for japan it said it expected the oecd to post current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in large part to 50 dlrs barrel rise in 1987 oil prices it said the current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 it said it expected west germany to post 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan 76 billion dlr surplus this year the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16 50 dlrs barrel by end 1987 and 15 50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly ragged it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose further 13 pct on its trade weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year 18 pct drop the average mark dollar rate is put at 80 marks this year and 70 in 1988 while the yen dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said this is not crash scenario but the dollar steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with fireball rather than three point landing the eiu said talking will not stop the dollar slide for long and the february meeting of finance ministers of the group of five and canada produced scant promise of either decisive shift to more expansive policies in west germany and japan or tighter fiscal policy it said it said the key to the dollar fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy government assets despite prospects of sustaining currency loss thus far they have been willing the eic said adding that if japan was deterred from buying bonds the dollar would collapse to contain such currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and third world debt crisis it said on trade the eiu said prospects for 1987 look increasingly sick import growth forecast in december at pct is now seen slowing down to around pct in 1987 with recovery only to pct in 1988 it said the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature sluggish pct growth in 1987 against the pct forecast in december the eiu said on the export side it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe while japan exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by exporters would respond only marginally to lower more competitively priced dollar it said in most of europe and in japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 however rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current oecd average of three pct non oil commodity prices will show modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984 the eiu said after rise of 18 pct in 1986 the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988 it said it said oecd industrial production would rise by only pct in 1987 after weak pct increase in 1986

trade issues straining ec patience with japan member states of the european community are starting to run out of patience with japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec countries bear witness to new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec however they said an all out trade war may be far off as ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan senior ec diplomats gave generally favourable reaction to an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could raise tariffs on range of japanese products if the carries out threat to make similar move on april 17 the ec tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body gatt would be designed to stop diversion of exports to the ec market from that of the the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec trade deficit with japan reached record 13 billion dlrs in march up from 94 billion in february in 1986 japanese exports to the ec totalled 30 67 billion dlrs up pct from 1985 while ec exports to japan fell one pct to 12 43 billion dlrs in paris trade minister michel noir said france has decided to give japan taste of its own medicine burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen coquilles st jacques will be restricted by strict application of french quality standards something ec states say often happens to their own exports entering japan britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the city of london because the british cable and wireless company lost out in competition for japanese telecommucations contract however british officials in london have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened by contrast west germany with the ec most successful economy has never threatened tokyo with sanctions preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to japan the ec commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years substituting general calls for action by japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas at present it is for instance pressuring japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits to ensure ec companies have chance to win contracts for the building of new international airport and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars ec officials say these tactics yield some benefits but often the japanese announce modifications of their non tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only token amount they stress however that any action must be taken by the ec as whole to stop beggar my neighbour action one of the problems britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in frankfurt or amsterdam they point out

lyng opens japan talks on farm trade barriers agriculture secretary richard lyng opens talks with japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of japanese rice beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected but in an interview with reuters during the flight to tokyo yesterday lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on japan agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on tokyo to open its markets the japanese have said they are happy we are coming but they are not going to give us anything lyng said officials do not expect any japanese concessions during lyng two week visit here any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month they said if there is anything of consequence to offer prime minister yasuhiro nakasone would take it with him when he visits washington later in the month one official said lyng plans to ask japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases private rice trader visited tokyo last week requesting japan buy 200 000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake japan has rejected the overture saying tokyo maintains policy of self sufficiency in rice lyng will also press japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by april 1988 because he believes japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed he cited the example of california company which transports live cattle to japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota the cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal he said officials said the japan livestock industry promotion corporation which regulates beef imports was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and japanese beef prices were rising japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports along with beef the will also press japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by april 1988 some officials believe japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the japanese mandarin orange industry the quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice and japanese officials have said lyng has resurrected past proposal that japan buy surplus foodgrains for donation to developing countries but some officials are skeptical action will be taken lyng will also urge japan to put its domestic farm policies including rice on the negotiating table during gatt talks in geneva he said japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible reprisals

deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the trade deficit or buoy the economy the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs similarly the senate budget committee has approved plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year in terms of the economy 37 38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander touche ross federal budget policy analyst at best it will have small positive effect collander said in an interview federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar the government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar but volcker has warned that further fall in the dollar value is fraught with danger such decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit in addition in february officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce consumption particularly federal spending if you don deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten recession kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets there no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it not enough silvia told reuters the trade deficit has become one of the government most vexing and persistent problems the 1986 deficit was 169 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year end in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986 1991 period by last year gramm rudman balanced budget law while the new law set ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs for political reasons 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross collander to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained anything less than that will now look like failure to wall street the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year the senate budget committee has called for deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts
volcker urges quick aid to debtor nations federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth but solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing there is clearly danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in timely way volcker told the senate banking committee the borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them he said brazil has the potential for becoming leading world economic power but it is in difficult position today volcker said he said it will take concerted effort to regularize brazil external payments the key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of brazilian authorities he said both brazil and its creditors have strong incentive to work together volcker said regarding trade imbalances volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations in addition the united states must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies volcker said we need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects he said
japan given little hope of avoiding sanctions top official said japan has little chance of persuading the to drop threatened trade sanctions despite the efforts of japanese team that left for washington today michael armacost under secretary of state for political affairs was asked at press conference whether japan moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the not to impose tariffs on japanese imports said and replied it is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described armacost said the hopes japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues there are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues he said the question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the trade imbalance or whether congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation he said

reagan seeks romania trade concession president reagan called for continued nondiscriminatory treatment for romanian exports to the united states in the face of congressional opposition because of the bucharest government record on human rights white house statement said reagan decision to press for continuation of so called most favored nation mfn status for romania had been exceptionally difficult and came after all options were seriously considered but the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the bucharest government the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from romania and gave the united states influence on human rights practices there the statement was issued as reagan sent to congress requests for one year extensions of mfn for romania hungary and china the house of representatives has attached to trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny mfn for romania pending certification by reagan that the country had made progress on human rights there is no controversy over continuation of mfn for hungary and china
ec official faults trade bill sir roy denman head of the ec delegation in washington said pending trade legislation is misguided attempt to deal with the nation trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form to think that you can deal with trade deficit by legislation is mistake he told the foreign trade association here denman told reporters that possible retaliation which he warned of in letter to house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski would not necessarily be on product for product basis retaliation does not have to be matched product to product denman said he said in the case of textiles import restrictions however retaliation would be against textile exports certainly if restrictions were imposed on european exports of textiles to the the community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on textile exports to europe denman said he also took exception to proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs this would conflict with international obligations throw large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang he warned of the tariff proposals denman also took exception to efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party he said adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another
gatt round may stop growing trade problems successful new gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners trade representative clayton yeutter said yeutter in new zealand for informal gatt ministerial talks told reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient that is really strong rationale why we need new gatt round he said the very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems the eighth gatt round of negotiations was launched at punta del este in uruguay in september 1986 agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time the growing debt burden of latin american and african nations will also provide impetus for the gatt round to succeed he said clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that the basic objective of the new gatt round he said but he said the gatt round is long term endeavour it will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries but it will make difference in 10 to 15 years it worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two he said they ought to be very strongly supported in the gatt round as mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future he said
nakasone hard pressed to soothe anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in bid to defuse mounting anger over japanese trade policies but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell president ronald reagan and key congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april 29 coincided with news that japan recorded 14 billion dlr trade surplus last month more than 70 pct higher than year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up package of short term economic measures until after its 1987 88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government short term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987 88 fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over 80 pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan longer term economic plans high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as follow up to maekawa report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee recommendations subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan total output or gross national product around 1993 or 1995 last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and very gradual appreciation of the yen to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 from 150 now
