energy petrochemical industry cheap oil feedstocks the weakened dollar and plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined petrochemical industry to record profits this year with

plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones analysts say the chemical industry biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said oreffice speaking at meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong dollar dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs believe the entire chemical industry is headed for

13 billion dlrs 54 pct leap from 1985 the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by combination of luck and planning said pace john dosher dosher said last year fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early 1980s finally virtually all

chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse grace lt gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some

new leader coming to sec in challenging era president reagan nominee as top policeman for the nation securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder 58 year old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five member securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec ability to enforce securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the hutton investment banking firm brought wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981 in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission current priorities the sec currently has about 000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in 1934 the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation 35th president other former chairmen include william douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the supreme court in 1939 and william casey who served during president nixon first term and was reagan director of the central intelligence agency until his death earlier this year

warns of dependence on foreign oil white house ordered report said that growing reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security the energy department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil but makes no recommendations president reagan and most congressmen have previously ruled out tax on foreign oil as way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry energy secretary john herrington said in statement that although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports the report said imports last year were 33 pct of consumption and by the mid 1990s could rise to 50 pct among the report options to ease reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the reagan administration president reagan ordered the study last september citing determination that the country never again become captive to foreign oil cartel referring to the opec led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s the report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for oil firms to find and produce new oil as well as to cut imports but on the whole the tax would depress the nation economy

royal dutch shell earnings sharply lower royal dutch shell group lt rd as earnings for 1986 from the fell sharply because of difficult market conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods shell chairman peter holmes said the shell oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg the group earlier reported drop in net income for the year to 54 billion stg from 03 billion previously with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts shell transport and trading plc lt sc shares the arm of the group rose to 11 39 stg from close last night of 11 06 stg analysts noted that general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 also windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts industry analyst chris rowland of barclays de zoete wedd noted however he added there could well be sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 the impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which typically reacted to oil price changes with about half year lag analysts said holmes said that in the upstream sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all only two of the oil majors had managed to make profit in the period with shell oil being one of them the decrease in earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader holmes added continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue exploration activity exploration is currently pretty flat we are going to go on but at 16 18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn he said renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the north sea and the requires prices of around 25 dlrs barrel ultimately this would lead to rise in imports if you are not exploring you are not going to find anything he noted oil production had dropped some half mln barrels day bbd in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs barrel this favored opec attempts to stabilise prices as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non opec marginal production shutting down opec has done pretty extraordinarily well everything is moving in its direction he added

exxon official urges planning for next oil surge world governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non middle east supplies diminish exxon corp lt xon director and senior vice president donald mcivor said policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the middle east he said in speech prepared for delivery to the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference it appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact he said mcivor said 37 of the world 30 000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered only 11 of these 37 super giant fields lie outside the middle east and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years three of them in the middle east he said he also said that since 1970 the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels year more than half of remaining proved reserves are in the middle east he said mcivor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the middle east because each addition contributes to diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability it is important to enhance the likelihood of home country discoveries with measures such as non discriminatory and stable taxation and minimum regulation together with opening up of acreage for exploration he said increasing reliance on the middle east will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum he added

energy petrochemical industry cheap oil feedstocks the weakened dollar and plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf corp lt gaf privately held cain chemical inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants oil companies such as ashland oil inc lt ash the kentucky based oil refiner and marketer

plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones analysts say the chemical industry biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said oreffice speaking at meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong dollar dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs believe the entire chemical industry is headed for

13 billion dlrs 54 pct leap from 1985 the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by combination of luck and planning said pace john dosher dosher said last year fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early 1980s finally virtually all major chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses the restructuring touched

chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse grace lt gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some

opec differentials not seen posing major problems some opec states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six month old price and output pact in vienna next week oil analysts say they said nigeria which holds the opec conference presidency and qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive there has also been speculation by japanese traders that opec might want to mark up prices of high sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices but most experts agree that major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of dent in opec new unity all opec members can make good case for changing differentials said one analyst with major oil company but at the end of the day the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered iran libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in package many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil rich heavy crudes and gasoline rich lighter grades at its last meeting in december opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers opec also decided to limit first half 1987 output to 15 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16 mln for the third quarter and 18 mln for the fourth analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but opec will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say the 18 dlr figure is based on basket of six opec and one non opec crudes opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes with 65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest extra heavy crudes were among those left out industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices several experts say only one quarter to one third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices nigeria especially found its gasoline rich bonny light crude now opec highest priced grade at 18 92 dlrs barrel was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain brent in february and march nigeria production shrank below its 238 mln bpd opec quota spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr barrel but mehdi varzi chief oil analyst with london kleinwort grieveson securities doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue he said

most japan firms not renewing iran term contracts most japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than opec official levels industry sources said they said cargo of the mideast benchmark crude dubai traded yesterday at 16 50 dlrs barrel compared to its official price of 17 42 dlrs only one japanese company has renewed its term contract for iranian crude oil for the second quarter the sources said the sources said japanese companies had been lifting total of about 185 000 barrels per day bpd of iranian crude under term contracts but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter it is lifting just 10 000 to 15 000 bpd they said this move could inspire iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in april but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices if the spot price of dubai goes above 17 30 dlrs we would probably buy iranian crude at the official price one japanese refiner said we don intend to put pressure on them he added buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official opec prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower oil traders said they said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding opec crude to purchase at the official prices qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in march the problem is likely to recur in april adding to that country surplus the traders added that iraq had dissociated itself from opec december production agreement while agreeing to the fixed prices but oil analysts said if opec keeps group output close to its first half 1987 ceiling of 15 mln bpd supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter they also said if opec holds its official price structure based on reference price of 18 dlrs spot price fluctuations should be limited to 16 50 to 17 20 dlrs range for dubai and 17 to 18 dlrs range for the north sea brent blend one japanese refiner said at the moment there lot of pressure on opec particularly on qatar but if they hold out there will be no problem and beginning to trust their ability nigerian oil minister and opec president rilwanu lukman told news conference in lagos yesterday nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices he said opec believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products reducing them to levels well below this time last year he said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude japanese refiner said the european and markets are beginning to look better so opec might be quite lucky

opec wants 18 dlr oil price oapec official opec believes world oil prices should be set around fixed average price of 18 dlrs barrel oapec assistant general secretary abdelaziz al wattari said today in speech to european community ec oapec opec seminar in luxembourg released here al wattari said opec believes the world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around fixed average price of 18 dlrs but he warned that defense of the 18 dlr barrel level had caused hardship for opec countries who had been forced to curtail production and he warned that such cutbacks by opec states could not be sustained in some cases for opec to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs barrel its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production al wattari said such cutbacks cannot in certain cases be sustained al wattari said as well as financial and marketing pressures some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies he added al wattari noted that total opec output was below the organization agreed ceiling for all member countries in february although this had meant sacrifices the effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability though restored to good level was still under pressure al wattari said lasting stability in the world market requires wider scope of international cooperation he added he said some non opec oil producing countries had shown political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with opec but although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by opec they were insufficient in terms of volume he added the overall majority of non opec producers have not responded sufficiently to opec calls for supply regulation he said al wattari said an 18 dlr barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside opec to continue while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high cost areas outside opec such price would no longer encourage protectionist measures he added fadhil al chalabi opec deputy secretary general also addressing the seminar added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market cooperation between arab states and europe was advantageous for both sides al chalabi said adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full fledged euro arab dialogue

iea forecasts slower growth in oecd oil demand growth in oil consumption in the western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with pct in 1986 the international energy agency said oil use in the 24 member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35 mln barrels day the iea said in its latest monthly report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as was the case in 1986 but if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year pct the iea said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that takes place natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 it said iea estimates on april one put oil stocks held in the oecd area at 428 mln tonnes or 98 days of forward consumption this is about the same as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset reduction in stocks company stocks on land in the oecd rose to 326 mln tonnes on april one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986 the year on year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years iea said oil stocks on land in the united states and canada were put at 206 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on january one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively oil stocks in western europe were 147 mln tonnes down from the 154 mln tonnes on january one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption the iea said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed small rise in january of 400 000 bpd but decline of bpd in february and bpd in march and it is possible that final data will show larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said world oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45 bpd from 47 bpd in the last quarter of 1986 this drop was mostly due to decline in opec crude production to around 15 bpd in february march from 16 bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies the iea said total opec oil supply totalled 17 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non opec countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28 bpd in the same 1986 period drop in saudi arabian output to tentatively forecast bpd in march from bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said

lawson oil tax breaks to help new fields revenue two new tax relief measures for oil producers announced today are aimed at encouraging developments in the north sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry the inland revenue said in post budget statement earlier chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced in his annual budget to parliament that from today companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against petroleum revenue tax prt to date full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself when its income stream began but was not immediately available against other development expenditure the statement said the new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today and will improve the post tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed it said lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for prt relief to be offset against prt liability this means oil related expenditure in the or on the continental shelf which has not become allowable in particular field within three years of being incurred to be allowed against prt liability in any oil field the inland revenue said this brings the scope of prt relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs it said in due course the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg year it calculated the inland revenue statement also included other technical measures that lawson did not comment on in his budget speech these included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of prt exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation tidier rules on incorrectly allowed prt expenditure reliefs were announced while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and advance corporation tax relating to the so called ring fence of activities in the and its continental shelf the finance bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in november it said gareth lewis davies north sea expert with stockbrokers wood mackenzie and co inc in edinburgh thought the two reliefs on prt would help the depressed offshore industry he said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller north sea fields such osprey don and arbroath would be brought forward early development of the larger miller and bruce oil fields might also be encouraged he said lewis davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry which suffered huge amount of lay offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year he pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the southern basin this means more jobs could be created as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the north sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south he said the prt relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year

santos says profits hit by oil price fall leading australian onshore oil and gas producer santos ltd lt stos said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil condensate and liquefied petroleum gas lpg the cooper basin producer earlier reported fall in net profit to 88 67 mln dlrs from 144 04 mln in 1985 santos chairman sir brian massy greene said in statement that increased production particularly of oil and lpg along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays were helping santos deal with an adverse business climate santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of 1985 rights issue and had cash reserves of 381 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401 mln year earlier it said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders funds had fallen to 01 from 54 santos yesterday announced 00 dlr share takeover bid for the 96 93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company lt tmoc resources ltd valuing the target at 248 mln dlrs santos said 75 pct of its loans were dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge at year end it held 145 mln dlrs enough to meet all 1987 repayments santos said it had successful gas exploration program finding 172 billion cubic feet in south australia but oil exploration was less successful with 62 mln barrels added to reserves less than depletion during the year cooper basin producers are committed to two year scheme to double gas exploration while santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism but it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the import parity price scheme it makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when australia oil self sufficency is expected to decline rapidly massy green said
energy oil output energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost oil production but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods herrington said such plan would cost 200 mln dlrs year the white house reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal herrington proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department report on energy and the national security the report said oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security he has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria increase production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third he said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production in any case officials say president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and gasoline tax options which meet herrington criteria include loan price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs five pct tax credit for exploration and development it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels day at cost of 740 mln dlrs year five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures it would increase production by 80 000 barrels day at cost of 65 mln dlrs lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs herrington also pressed anew for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the arctic national wildlife refuge which may hold nine billion barrels herrington said he understood the reagan reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his department energy security study would make strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry another move herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house is to raise the fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100 000 barrels day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000 this he said would further bolster national security in case of an oil supply disruption

oil prices rise on saudi effort crude oil prices rallied today moving over 17 00 dlrs barrel because of saudi arabia determined effort to support prices analysts said the saudis and other opec nations are jawboning the market hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting said sanford margoshes oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc but opec is not out of the woods yet by longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating he added oil industry analysts said saudi arabia has led the attempt to get other opec members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december the analysts said that to get others to hold the line saudi arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the gulf cooperation council last weekend and at the cooperation council oil ministers meeting the previous week the saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil analysts said they are trying to make sure that no one discounts and to prevent that it appears that saudi arabia or some other opec member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales margoshes said he added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like qatar which has had trouble selling oil but it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts analysts said that saudi arabia with assistance from opec president rilwanu lukman was trying to avoid an emergency opec meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the december pact is falling apart daniel mckinley oil analyst with smith barney upham harris and co said both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took small spark to bring on short covering rally he believes an iranian trade mission to tokyo which refused discounts to japanese buyers brought japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of may dubai which sent prices up on mideast sours with dubai trading up to 16 50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15 63 dlrs and then spilled over into the north sea crude oil market traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of brent for japan and european trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments north sea brent today rose over 17 00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17 05 dlrs up one dlr opec members denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions indonesian oil minister subroto said today that opec production was below the 15 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on opec production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level the production probably is about their quota level and largely because saudi arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as result margoshes said analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally some believe prices can continue to rise if saudi arabia and opec hold steady in refusal to discount but others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors including demand which could cut the rally short marion stewart an indepedent petroleum economist said slow growth in the economies of the and oecd would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about pct over 1986

australian minister sees targeted oil tax strategy australia crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of targeted rather than broadly based approach federal resources and energy minister gareth evans told meeting here he told the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference there was prospect of developing package that would recognise the government economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry concerns evans was referring to nearly completed government review of oil taxation evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years these include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on old bass strait oil found before september 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last september he said the industry through the apea has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against background of weak prices and australia relatively low exploration levels while nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas evans said he said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation rrt legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in given area to be deductible as previously reported rrt is tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects apea has said it is not true profit based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects evans said the decision not to change rrt was based more than anything on the government desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules

india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gap india is searching for non communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told reuters most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in 1984 comes from two state trading firms the state trading corp stc and the minerals and metals trading corp mmtc the two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indian exports commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading one trade source said india has targetted countries that depend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports however countertrade deals still make up only small part of india total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended december the sources said countertrade accounted for just five pct of india 25 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 86 ended march against almost nothing in 1984 85 official figures show however the figures exclude exchanges with the eastern bloc paid in non convertible indian rupees the sources said total trade with the soviet union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and crude oil is estimated at 04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986 87 against three billion in 1985 86 indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country large trade deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia venezuela and brazil the trade sources said the trade deficit which hit an estimated record 96 billion dlrs in 1985 86 is expected to decline to billion in the current fiscal year but the push to include non communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said one source said india is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break gatt rules as member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt india cannot officially support bartering the mmtc recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails mmtc recent global tenders now include clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to india trade official said adding that the policy remains flexible we also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to india the trade official said early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs and railway equipment to india that they stood better chance if they bought indian goods or services in return the trade sources said illustrating the point the official said south korean firm recently agreed to sell drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state run oil and natural gas commission in return the south koreans gave verbal assurance to buy indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract against the 25 pct sought by new delhi the trade official said we selected the korean firm because its bid was the lowest he added countertrade is helping african countries short of foreign currency to import goods india has signed trade protocol to buy up to 15 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from zimbabwe in exchange for indian goods including jute bags and cars but despite india new drive countertrade has some inherent problems they added it is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced one trade source said the other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants another added barter is also restrictive we look upon it as temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty this is why countertrade has not been made law in india it does not even figure in the country foreign trade policy

energy drilling industry the drastic cutbacks in drilling last year are rapidly deflating the united state natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said faltering deliverability of natural gas commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current rig count to near 000 by 1990 some analysts said the need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring resurgence of activity in the gulf of mexico offshore waters where some of the nation largest gas reserves are located we think an upturn in drilling is imminent said james crandall an analyst with salomon brothers inc many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they re betting that the gas market will be back in balance in year or two the prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs barrel to less than half that today relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs barrel are not enough to spur return to the heady days of 1981 when the drilling rig count soared to record high of more than 500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages the latest weekly hughes tool co lt ht rig count barometer of the oil industry health showed 761 rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year in 1986 the hughes rig count began the year at 915 but dived to post world war ii low of 663 in july as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times ike kerridge hughes economist said in 1986 the united states replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won be any better this year he added we don have the options we do with oil imports of gas from canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost only about trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates george gaspar an oil analyst with robert baird and co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for new cycle of gradual increases in drilling we anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies that means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid 1988 gaspar said gasper said he sees new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 000 in december of 1989 much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years some of the industry biggest companies such as exxon corp lt xon mobil corp mob and union texas petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the gulf of mexico crandall said for example conoco inc dupont lt dd subsidiary will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the gulf of mexico deepest production platform which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day but boone pickens who has acquired huge texas and kansas gas reserves for his mesa limited partnership lt mlp in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of recovery pickens predicts the rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do the rigs won go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs barrel said pickens 58 adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 000 again in his lifetime tenneco inc lt tgt one of the largest gas producers is skeptical that need for additional gas drilling exists tenneco vice president joe foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years supply current spot market prices of about 50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said

iea sees one pct growth in 1987 oecd oil demand growth in oil consumption in the western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with pct in 1986 the international energy agency iea said oil use in the 24 countries of the oecd increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35 mln bpd the iea said in its monthly oil market report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as in 1986 but if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year pct it said the iea said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that happens natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels iea estimates on april put oil stocks in the oecd area at 428 mln tonnes representing 98 days of forward consumption this is about the same level as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset reduction in stocks it said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed small rise in january of mln bpd but decline of mln bpd in february and mln bpd in march it is possible that final data will show larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said company stocks on land in the oecd rose to 326 mln tonnes on april against 316 mln on april 1986 governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period the year on year trend of government stock building is continuing with year on year company stocks also rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years the iea noted oil stocks on land in the and canada were put at 206 mln tonnes on april down from the 214 mln tonnes on january and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively oil stocks in western europe were 147 mln tonnes on april down from the 154 mln on january but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption world oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45 mln bpd from 47 mln bpd in last quarter 1986 this drop was mostly due to decline in opec crude production to around 15 mln bpd in february march from 16 mln bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies the iea said total opec crude oil supply was 15 mln bpd in the first quarter plus mln bpd of ngls compared with 17 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17 mln average for the whole of 1986 supply from non opec countries totalled 28 mln bpd against 28 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986 drop in saudi arabian output to tentatively forecast mln bpd in march from mln bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said saudi arabia opec assigned output quota is 133 mln bpd

preussag says payment of 1986 dividend not certain spokesman for preussag ag lt prsg said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay dividend on 1986 results he was commenting on preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985 preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following difficult year in 1985 managing board chairman guenther sassmannshausen said in december the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends the spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board the preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group other divisions the spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show net profit in 1986 adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65 mln marks from 103 mln the year before the preussag world group made net loss of 13 mln marks in 1985 after net profit of 154 mln the year before domestic group net profit fell to 77 mln from 122 mln the statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector the reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year preussag domestic group turnover rose to 48 billion marks in 1986 from 29 billion in 1985 helped by the first time consolidation of 951 mln marks of turnover from its majority owned oil and gas subsidiary deilmann ag domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was billion marks it said without giving comparison figures preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell pct to 94 400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose to 182 900 tonnes from 174 500 tonnes preussag said its amalgamated metal corporation plc amc subsidiary whose results are included in the world group accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year amc large losses in 1985 caused principally by the international tin crisis were the reason behind the world group losses that year

analyst says ussr winter grains hurt by weather the soviet union winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said grain analyst and meteorologist gail martell author of the ef hutton publication global crop news said in her latest report that the soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the due to potential crop damage compared with last year the outlook for the soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said but it still too early to talk about disastrous losses lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains key wheat growing areas of the southern ukraine and north caucasus received on 25 35 pct of autumn precipitation she said the bitter winter cold temperatures which broke record lows that had stood for four decades also may have taken its toll on soviet winter crops she said however she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have well insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage the ussr has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the july 1986 june 1987 marketing year primarily from canada the european community argentina and australia martell said she cited number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional soviet import demand last fall dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture depleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy martell was also skeptical of soviet claim for 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports however she said the remains supplier of last resort for the soviet union noting that the soviets have only just recently begun their first grain purchases of the 1986 87 season by buying 25 mln tonnes of corn martell cited usda statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the is only major supplier of grain to the ussr during years of heavy soviet demand in 1984 85 the supplied 41 pct of record soviet grain imports of 55 mln tonnes but in 1985 86 the soviet union bought 29 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the for only 24 pct of that total while the usda soviet import target for grain for 1986 87 was 22 mln tonnes many grain analysts have revised their estimates of soviet imports up to 25 28 mln tonnes she said
economic spotlight china must preserve farmland if we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980 there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on xu jinfeng middle aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the world population but only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned china into net grain exporter for the first time in 1985 and again in 1986 but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and slightly smaller amount last year it gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years we lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began official xu said since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up last year we lost land to new railway line xu said but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added the issue of land loss is matter of major concern to the peking leadership which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year the present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said an article in the official press explaining the new measures it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it said china has large population and its land resources are badly deficient an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china people get enough grain to eat the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops to offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china 200 mln city residents rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices chen zuyuan communist party secretary of village in the eastern province of zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out price rise raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability said china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term we must be very careful we have very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises he said the problem is how to do it the shanghai official said rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late 1970s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land as the expiration date of the 15 year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it for most of the period of communist rule the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative new measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long term investment the newspaper said

iwc says effect of lower support prices limited efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the international wheat council iwc says in its latest monthly report faster results could be achieved by policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the united states the iwc says in survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters argentina australia canada the ec and the in some countries for example australia and argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for long period this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency for example between 1985 86 and 1986 87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 30 to 179 44 european currency units ecus it dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 the high cost of supporting farm prices has put strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 this was partly due to increased production in china and india the period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the argentina the and australia by lower acreages in argentina reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower acreages are attributed to official incentives

shultz ussr trip fuels talk of eep wheat offer speculation the united states will offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union appears to have reached new level of intensity in the run up to secretary of state george shultz visit later this month to moscow rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi annual grain talks in february moscow decision at that time to reenter the corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects shultz is set to arrive in moscow april 13 shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of wheat subsidy offer under the export enhancement program eep coupled with the announcement of his visit to moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as clear signal that the reagan administration was preparing an offer administration officials in and out of the agriculture department have been extremely tight lipped about the prospects of subsidy offer but usda officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not done deal is live possibility prominent grain trade representatives many of whom asked not to be identified continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent others who one month ago claimed deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out rep pat roberts kan yesterday went so far as to predict subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks aides to roberts said he had spoken to republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials richard fritz director of international marketing at wheat associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer washington made peking earlier this year when usda approved subsidies to china of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat some grain trade representatives say four mln tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more soviet purchases of corn and open the door to sales of soybeans as ever one of the crucial sticking points in wheat deal would appear to be price last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the soviets subsidized wheat but were embarrassed when moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15 dlr per tonne subsidy still left wheat prices far above world market prices the administration decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent shultz from saying the soviets were chortling because washington was offering soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to housewives the conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the grain belt would favor subsidy offer in addition the ussr has made it clear it would consider buying wheat if it were priced more competitively however observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the white house had decided to expand the export enhancement program to include not only the soviets but also much broader list of countries instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the soviets that last minute change of heart adds measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the soviet union
japan study urges foreign access to farm markets japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture government report said the white paper on agriculture for the year ended march 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt talks will help prepare japan to improve access agriculture ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in japan tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self sufficiency in food japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs down from 61 pct some 20 years ago official figures show the paper said japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand supply imbalances the relative shortage of farmland in japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices it said the strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part time farmers the paper said this could make it difficult to improve the industry structure the paper said to solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self supporting it said

conservation figures seen neutral bearish agriculture department usda figures for highly erodible land enrolled into the conservation reserve program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish although some said full state by state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact out of 10 mln acres only mln acres were accepted in corn that neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for dale gustafson of drexel burnham lambert said the usda said it had accepted 10 572 402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on total of 11 254 837 acres gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as result of the latest figures but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly the usda is due to release planting intentions figures march 31 indications of heavy sign up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63 to 67 mln acres from 67 to 69 mln richard loewy analyst with prudential bache securities said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures the mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing he added the usda later released the state by state breakdown of the enrollment figures loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring he said the trade was definitely looking higher so certificates are going to be less than expected the usda offered special corn bonus rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates the bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel based on the farm program payment yield for corn for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve katharina zimmer analyst for merrill lynch futures said the conservation sign up was slightly higher than she had expected although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures think it is friendly for the market at least in the long run she said susan hackmann of agrianalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign up or the latest addition it seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program she said hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as result of the conservation sign up she added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60 zimmer of merrill lynch said she would be making slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres new crop corn prices at the chicago board of trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of large sign up in the program despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make substantial difference to final production figures
soviet union to import more grain in 86 87 usda the agriculture department increased its estimate of 1986 87 grain purchases by the soviet union to 28 mln tonnes up two mln tonnes from last month in its monthly report on the soviet grain situation the usda said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month usda said the increased purchasing is somewhat surprising because of recent higher soviet crop estimates all of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn usda said of the 28 mln tonnes total 15 mln tonnes will be wheat 12 mln tonnes coarse grains and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses usda said usda noted that the soviet winter grain crop suffered through severe winter and spring field work has been delayed the severe winter is believed to have resulted in above average winter kill usda said some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the soviet union has been actively buying grain recently usda said moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986 87 including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain
senate panel makes conservation exemption the senate agriculture committee approved measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from federal conservation requirement sen edward zorinsky neb said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who between 1981 and 1985 planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with row crop an official from leading conservation group who asked not to be identified said the panel move was an unfortunate first action because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations established under the 1985 farm bill
cbt traders look ahead to spring plantings chicago board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program that gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees with the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybean corn ratio of would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances an announcement late friday that the usda will lift the limited cross compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the south to put soybean land back into cotton one of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the south to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said

south african maize estimate called conservative the south african government maize production estimate of mln tonnes for the current year is rather too conservative leading grain and produce merchants kahn and kahn pty ltd said the company in detailed report estimated the harvest as high as mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 25 mln tonnes this paradoxically is creating problem for the maize board kahn and kahn said it said the maize export price currently is depressed and the board is probably confronted with the necessity to maintain or slightly increase the internal price of maize again to offset the ostensible loss which must be faced on exporting surplus amounts
commodity pacts more oriented towards market consuming countries chastened by the collapse of international tin council itc price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving reuter survey showed they want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non members undermining the pacts consumers and producers mindful of itc buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations importers and some key exporting countries have shunned generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed the international cocoa organization icco last week set precise limits on what the buffer stock manager bsm could do under the new agreement it imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the bsm from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non member cocoa this will help prevent lower quality cocoa from malaysia the world fourth largest producer undermining the market the cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the buffer stock manager must use when purchasing varying grades new international natural rubber agreement inra was adopted earlier this month in geneva importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases bank financing was particular feature of the failed itc buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling legal wrangles continue recent international coffee organization ico negotiations in london exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said consumers and small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant reduction in the share of brazil the world leading producer brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct the talks broke down and although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote international agreements exist for sugar and wheat these do not have any economic clauses but provide forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber the common fund for commodities with planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the nor the soviet union has ratified it officials in washington said the doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support officials in washington and malaysian officials in kuala lumpur expressed policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests we see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of commodity whose long term trend is downward official administration policy states the currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the international coffee agreement ica and inra but it is also member of the sugar and wheat pacts the did not join the international cocoa agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the state department said officials singled out the inra as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as market oriented agreement officials said canadian officials in ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik told reuters in kuala lumpur his country the world top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case malaysia is member of the association of tin producing countries atpc which produce 65 pct of world tin the atpc launched plan to limit member tin exports to 96 000 tonnes for year from march to cut the tin surplus to 50 000 from 70 000 economist in the west german ministry of agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements peter baron told reuters in london agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously but baron added no real sanctions are available for country that doesn stick to its obligations the german approach is sceptical we don think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries they were never meant to be vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be two way partnership in trade rather than disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through buffer stock have high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be foreign ministry official in tokyo said japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply government spokesman in paris said france is favourable to commodity pacts france large consumer and producer of sugar favours sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks indonesia foreign minister mochtar kusumaatmadja told reuters in jakarta these agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical but it another matter when there are structural problems but we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith nicaraguan external trade minister alejandro martinez cuenca said in london producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements the political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work martinez cuenca said the head of the economics department in the brazilian foreign ministry sebastiao do rego barros told reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps link with market reality if you have an agreement such as coffee with system of quotas with link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work unctad spokesman graham shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods

grain certs save 50 100 mln dlrs amstutz the use of generic commodity certificates or certs for fiscal years 1986 88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs department of agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz said speaking at house agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates amstutz said that the issuance of billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986 88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs however the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs resulting in net savings for the government of 50 100 mln dlrs he said without the use of certificates amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the commodity credit corporation ccc in addition 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from ccc inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory he said when asked to comment on recent study by the general accounting office that concluded certificates result in net cost to the government amstutz said gao underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs of the certificate program amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures gao underestimated this net loan activity amstutz said there is no question in the mind of the department of agriculture that these certificates have been very useful amstutz said immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity improved market price competitiveness higher farm income and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs he said certificates are an integral part of usda long range market oriented farm policy he said amstutz told subcommittee chairman rep dan glickman kans that usda is in the process of preparing an official response to the gao study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed

oecd farm subsidies study results detailed the results of controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd show japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies results of the study which has not been released by oecd because of objections from some countries were provided to reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified the oecd study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979 81 using new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent pse the study shows that on dairy products japan pse or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as percentage averaged 83 pct over 1979 81 with the european community at 68 pct and the united states 48 pct for wheat japan pse averaged 95 pct the ec 28 and the 17 japan rice pse was 68 pct compared to the ec 13 and the pct the oecd calculations show in coarse grains japan subsidies reached 107 pct compared with 27 pct for the ec and 13 pct for the japan beef subsidy was 54 pct versus 52 pct for the ec and pct for the oecd concluded for sugar japan pse was 48 pct versus 27 pct in the ec and 13 pct for the the study shows the oecd calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as canada australia and new zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the ec and japan the sources said subsidies in argentina and brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the oecd work officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the oecd ministerial meeting in paris during may some officials hope the oecd results will be used as basis for negotiations during the uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in geneva british agriculture minister michael jopling during visit to washington this week endorsed the oecd work as starting point for the uruguay round negotiations on agriculture he said the pse calculations provide tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture however the oecd study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said the agriculture department economic research service recently published study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the oecd results and update them to 1982 84 in some cases the results were substantially different than the oecd in part because farm policies in both the and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982 84 from the oecd base period of 1979 81 officials said for example the usda study found the united states subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982 84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the ec at zero to nine pct french maize producers association president marcel cazale citing the result of the usda calculation for corn told reporters last week that the united states subsidizes its farmers more than the ec however the sources said ec corn subsidies are probably higher than the now because of increases since 1984 officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to oecd so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation the updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in subsidy levels for sugar because the imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied marketing loan for rice officials added

awb calls for tighter wheat quality controls australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements the australian wheat board awb said many awb customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications the board said in submission to the royal commission into grain storage handling and transport many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in australia it said the commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower quality grades the awb submission said it stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping better industrial relations at grain terminals more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing it said the submission also said australia federal system impeded the awb role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat the awb called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment it is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored it said for example wheat grown in northern new south wales nsw might move more efficiently to brisbane in queensland than to sydney or newcastle in new south wales it said similarly southern nsw wheat might better be shipped to portland or geelong in victoria legislation giving state rail authorities monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment it said the awb said the current approach of state based bulk handling authorities is not essential although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained an appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26 500 and 34 700 dlrs to load 50 000 tonne vessel at various australian ports compared with 21 200 dlrs at houston and 16 300 at port cartier quebec for 60 000 tonner

conservation signup seen 10 to 12 mln acres grain traders and analysts look for 10 to 12 mln acre sign up in the usda conservation reserve program scheduled to be announced after 1400 cst today the usda probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted they said total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only mln acres so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week however some analysts said 10 to 12 mln acre sign up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers also acres set aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding so the impact on total corn production will be minimal they added
house approves pilot 92 disaster program the house of representatives approved bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant the one time pilot 92 program designed to assist farmers in kansas oklahoma michigan and parts of missouri was passed by 304 100 vote and sent to the senate although the bill includes narrow version of the 92 provision endorsed by the reagan administration the agriculture department withheld its support from the measure usda said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration proposed broad scale revision of farm programs the bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received to be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant different crop on that land this spring although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay usda estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs largely because of reduced crop forfeitures the bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the missouri and mississippi rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall flooding in addition the measure would require usda to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by congress last fall currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds usda plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses the administration said it opposed the bill because by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance usda also said the 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings usda said the 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the requirement to compensate fully disaster struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by congress the feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs usda estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs in january the senate approved bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments but the senate bill would not offer the 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program

numerous factors said point to ussr corn buying greater than anticipated need competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking soviet interest in corn industry and government officials said as rumors circulated through grain markets today that the soviet union has purchased an additional mln tonnes of corn industry and government sources noted number of factors that make soviet buying of corn likely first there are supply concerns some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes rather than the 210 mln announced therby increasing the soviet need for grain drop in argentine corn crop prospects could also affect soviet corn buying an agriculture department source said dry weather in argentina major corn supplier to the ussr and reported crop problems prompted usda to lower its argentine 1986 87 corn crop estimate this week to 11 mln tonnes down from 11 mln argentina corn exports were also cut by 500 000 tonnes to mln tonnes argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year corn for export usda official said with two mln tonnes of that booked for april june delivery to the ussr significant downside potential still exists for the argentine crop the official said which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to moscow if the soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking then they might need more than what argentina can provide during the april to june period he said current competitive prices for corn have also sparked soviet buying corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne argentine corn for 67 dlrs very competitive price spread and soviet sources said this price difference makes american corn competitive albert melnikov commercial counselor for the soviet union told reuters impending crop problems in argentina will likely cause those prices to rise and with the recently strong corn futures prices the soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is good time to buy sources said finally some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the ussr grains agreement four mln tonnes the soviet union may be hoping to convince the usda to offer moscow subsidy on wheat in an inteview with reuters this week usda secretary richard lyng said that no decision had been made on wheat subsidy offer but that such an offer had not been ruled out
feedgrain 92 supporters evaluate position advocates of 92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if disaster aid bill before the house agriculture committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat congressional sources said the disaster aid bill introduced by rep glenn english okla sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement 92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat an agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat but supporters of 92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled down version would not be equitable for farmers unless the english bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat it is more than simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally they said if the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat then supporters of 92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week sources said english has agreed to support an amendment by rep charles stenholm tex to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only but whether he would also back further reduction is unclear agricultural aides to english said the congressman first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers however if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat then english might consider an even greater cutback in the bill they said under 92 plan farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments rep arlan stangeland minn and harold volkmer mo have both expressed interest in expanding the english bill to include 92 program for feedgrains an aide said stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill but to be fair to all crops only small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land economists said opponents to 92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the house agriculture committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such program

brazil grain harvest faces storage problems storage problems with brazil record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an agriculture ministry spokesman said ministry spokesman leonardo brito speaking from brasilia told reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost he said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems brazil has storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop but brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed the states of sao paulo parana and rio grande do sul had between them 70 pct of the nation capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production the biggest problems are concentrated in the centre west growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity brito said the centre west whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space in addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain brito said finally there is shortage of lorries to transport the crops the sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries
australian wheat area to fall forecaster says australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10 40 mln hectares in 1987 88 from 11 72 mln sown in 1986 87 australian wheat forecasters pty ltd awf said in its first preliminary crop forecast but there was no reason to expect australian production in 1987 88 would be less than the 16 mln tonnes of last year the private forecaster said as crops in new south wales and queensland suffered from poor yields last season most of the fall in plantings was expected in western australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said the main reason for low western australia estimate was poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures but in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and june is not less than average awf said although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct awf said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops the lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and oats is cause for concern if those crops are to comprise high proportion of growers income awf said awf state area forecasts in mln hectares with 1986 87 production in mln tonnes are as follows crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year area crop 1987 88 1986 87 1986 87 queensland 82 82 95 07 17 40 victoria 53 63 25 australia 45 64 30 australia 53 46 60

sugar program cut sent to congress by usda the agriculture department formally transmitted to congress long awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments in letter to the congressional leadership accompanying the sugar program improvements act of 1987 peter myers deputy agriculture secretary said the reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 the payments would cost an estimated billion dlrs myers said the administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the house of representatives next week by rep john porter ill congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the house or senate because politically influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist the direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years it also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 000 short tons raw sugar per grower for example on the first 350 tons of production grower would receive cts per lb in fiscal 1988 cts in 1989 cts in 1990 and cts in 1991 the income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years whichever is less usda said myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry he said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said this has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing furthermore usda said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar containing products competitive advantage the result has been higher imports of sugar containing products and flight of processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar usda also said the current program imposes heavy cost on consumers and industrial users in fiscal 1987 usda said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing myers said the following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administration proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments quantity 1988 1989 1990 1991 first 350 tons 000 500 000 500 over 350 to 700 750 313 875 438 over 700 to 000 500 125 750 375 over 000 to 500 000 750 500 250 over 500 to 000 500 375 250 125 over 000 to 000 500 625 750 875 over 000 to 10 000 250 688 125 563 over 10 000 to 20 000 500 375 250 125 over 20 000 tons nil nil nil nil
more grain certificates needed study says more generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the certificate program to have its full effect on commodities according to study by sparks commodities inc the agriculture department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in two third certificate one third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989 carroll brunthaver president of sparks commodities told house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly 50 50 split between cash and certificates brunthaver said the sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season zero certificate case where no certificate program was assumed and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings the study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11 pct usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 when grain usage under certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct for the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case the sparks study said that billion dlrs or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs the study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined the sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash

cost of pik certificates to be eyed by congress congress eager to find budget savings launches review of the agriculture department generic commodity certificate program tomorrow amid signs usda and the general accounting office gao are at odds over how much the program has cost taxpayers the gao concluded in preliminary report last week that payment in kind or pik certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays administration officials who asked not to be identified said usda officials however took issue with the report saying it did not take into account storage handling and transport savings that accrue to the government the gao then decided to re examine the costs sources said the issue is an important one because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as means of cutting spending agriculture under secretary daniel amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley are set to testify before the senate agriculture committee tomorrow amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays and that savings to the commodity credit corp ccc almost equal costs department sources said usda estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage it was unclear whether the gao congress investigative arm would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs reagan administration sources said the gao is expected to point out that use of payment in kind pik certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold the testimony by amstutz and gao senior associate director brian crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit including considering limits on the use of pik certificates the ccc issues dollar denominated pik certificates or certs as partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for ccc commodities or cash between april and december 1986 ccc issued billion dlrs worth of certificates according to usda up to another billion dlrs worth could be issued between january and august 1987 according to usda certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate eliminating this practice called pik and roll would save the government billion dlrs between 1988 92 according to the congressional budget office cbo that estimate according to cbo official was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments the senate and house budget committees are known to be considering curbs on pik and roll transactions among other savings alternatives the gao last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs or between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays one administration official said however the gao has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on usda criticism department officials said the broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of crop year usda economic research service for example has found that between june and august last year the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel between september and november however certificates had only marginal impact on corn prices according to the ers study obtained by reuters

usda not planning any major pricing changes the agriculture department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices an agriculture department offical said we do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing said bob sindt usda assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week usda might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ascs posted prices to encourage interior pik and roll movement but sindt denied usda is planning any such changes if people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing we are not considering this he said sindt however did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system we are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy he said if we become convinced that we need to make change then appropriate adjustments will be made sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that usda price differentials between the new orleans gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates he said commodity operations deputy administrator ralph klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on speaking tour and will meet with ascs oficials in kansas city next week sindt said number of issues will be discussed at that meeting including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums he defended the usda differentials saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease the usda official also said that only those counties that use the gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices when asked if the usda emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates sindt discounted the idea he said usda has grain left in only about 250 barges and that under provisions of the program these all have to be emptied by the end of march

ec commission set to detail grain import plan the ec commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the ec in fulfilment of its agreement with the united states commission sources said under the accord reached following complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of spanish ec membership the ec will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum year up to end of 1990 all this produce will be imported into spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other ec countries the sources said it was possible that the spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year as it was rather late to make other arrangements they added that the choice for future years appears to lie between system of regular tenders and the setting of daily special levy applicable to spanish imports there will initially be no tax on re exports of maize and sorghum from spain to other ec countries although such tax could be imposed later the sources added

soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to good start and will have lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as 30 35 pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be problem there good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and late spring would require longer off pasture feeding they said the soviets are not in desperate situation they don have to buy grains now usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and half martell said

corn growers blast canada corn ruling canada ruling in favor of duty on corn was keen disappointment to the national corn growers association and has set dangerous precedent for other nations to follow said mike hall lobbyist for the association the french corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed in their complaint hall told reuters canadian government agency ruled today that farm policies are causing injury to canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel this was cleary political decision hall said the amount of corn we export to canada is insignificant the unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that canada bases its corn prices on futures prices and that american farm policy has driven down these prices thus causing lower prices to canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program hall said hall said this is new definition for injury but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack farm programs the french corn growers could now charge that farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed hall said the french have long wanted to control the imports of corn gluten feed into the community saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing european grain
dutch grain levy test case to start in april large dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as test case on the way the ec grain co responsibility levy is applied spokesman for dutch grain and feed trade association het comite told reuters het comite has been co ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and since december has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the business appeal court in the hague the basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country het comite has obtained temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying full guilder amount to the dutch grain commodity board the spokesman said het comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the business administration court in the hague oral proceedings are to begin on april 10 the spokesman said het comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged because the bill the firm received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from wide variety of origins the name of the company is not being made public the administration court is not expected to make final ruling on the case in the near future the het comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the appeal court in luxembourg and as result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved meanwhile the actions by dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek complete review in brussels of the way in which the levy is collected the spokesman said het comite as member of fefac the association of european animal feed manufacturers is also party to actions protesting the whole levy in the luxembourg appeal court

indonesian agriculture growth expected to slow indonesia agriculture sector will grow by just pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the embassy said in report production of indonesia staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 26 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 58 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on indonesia agricultural performance the government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26 mln tonnes with forecast 27 mln tonnes output in 1987 the report says wheat imports are likely to fall to mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of drawdown on stocks growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower yielding more resistant rice types the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices palm oil production is expected to increase by over pct in 1987 to 45 mln tonnes from 35 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720 000 tonnes from 695 000 tonnes in 1986 the report says but while production of soybeans in 1987 88 oct sept will rise to 075 mln tonnes from 980 000 in 1986 87 imports will also rise to supply new soybean crushing plant the report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as result of last september 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of rise in domestic demand the report said that indonesia overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid 1960s it compares with pct growth in 1985 and pct in 1984 the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

sugar policy may self destruct congressman leading farm state congressman jerry huckaby la warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year we re moving toward direction where we could self destruct the sugar program rep huckaby chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues told reuters in an interview huckaby who told sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases said he will deliver the same message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday he also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject huckaby said the campaign to urge halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons think if we re talking about dropping the quota another half mln tons lets say you re getting to the point where the program might not work he said ideally like to freeze things right where we are said huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in congress freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of mln tons the corn sweetener share of the market staying at just over 50 pct and sugar imports holding at about mln tons huckaby said decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said feel like if we didn expand production we could probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program huckaby said however much depends on whether high fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the sweetener market from just over 50 pct huckaby said he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share then sugar imports might be eliminated and sugar output severely reduced huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as staley and archer daniels midland soon this program is advantageous to the corn users they have some natural legitimate self interest in seeing that the program is preserved huckaby said huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled either through production allocations acreage or marketing controls huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the justice department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production don know if we will go this route but if we do there question in my mind at this point in time can you do that legally he said asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners huckaby said you build fragile house if you do it that way huckaby said he understands why cane and beet farmers have expanded production because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain but he said for sugar growers as whole expansion would not be good policy huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program the administration proposal is so drastic that don think it will get up head of steam huckaby said he said even more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program huckaby said the reagan administration should file complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade against the european community sugar policy he said ec policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market

glickman pushes hard for 92 farm plan implementation of one year 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of key house agriculture subcommittee as way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions we have budget driven farm policy it may be shame but we are locked into this said dan glickman kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains we need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer 92 plan if properly done could do both glickman announced this week plans to introduce 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains an aide to glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week glickman said 92 program which allows farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be major revision of the 1985 farm bill only an extension of the 50 92 option already provided under the current bill it is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals voluntary 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as usda has proposed 92 plan however would not be decoupling but simply different type of acreage diversion program glickman said decoupling delinking planting decisions from government payments is too much of policy change to approve at this point he said don think there is any interest in pursuing decoupling bill this year period unequivocal glickman said at the hearing sen rudy boschwitz minn cosponsor of the boren boschwitz decoupling plan said he supports short term 92 program as move to more permament decoupling plan boschwitz plans to introduce 92 plan in the senate his plan would guarantee certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to certain number of acres in county and provide tenant protection provisions know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction boschwitz said robbin johnson vice president of cargill inc testified in favor of decoupling decoupling would end the current bias in farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said 92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant officials from the national corn growers association and the national cattlemen association said their groups oppose any 92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers but when asked if his association were forced to choose between ten pct cut in target prices or 92 program larry johnson of the corn growers said they would agree to 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels

around mln acres said to be idled by 92 92 program would have very little impact on acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional mln acres of cropland every year according to report from the agriculture department the savings resulting from the additional mln acres idled would be little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10 20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said the usda report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 92 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested the likelihood that the 92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said the returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the usda report said the 92 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high production high risk areas where cost of production is high said keith collins director of usda economics analysis staff in the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation collins said usda estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 92 mln acres of corn 500 000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500 000 acres of cotton production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500 000 bales of cotton the report said in determining whether to participate producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate the risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis what you re giving up under 92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production collins said for producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 92 but for high cost producers 92 would be more attractive also as loan rates get lower collins said there would be more incentives to participate in 92 program would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments collins said in speech earlier today before the national grains and feed association usda secretary richard lyng said it is too late to implement 92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month

corn market skewed by soviet buying recent purchases of corn by the soviet union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the gulf export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said many dealers expect the usda will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the gulf versus the interior which dealer in davenport iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents bushel by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain by lowering ascs county posted prices for corn the usda could encourage farmers to engage in pik and roll corn sales where pik certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed if the usda acts soon as many dealers expect the movement would break the gulf corn basis the usda has been using the gulf price to determine county posted prices one dealer said it should be taking the average of the gulf price and the price in kansas city which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior midwest but we don know when they might do it an ohio dealer said which has created uncertainty in the market the usda started the pik certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage yesterday usda issued report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 85 billion dlrs in pik certificates it has issued to farmers in lieu of cash payments had to date been exchanged for grain with several billion dlrs worth of additional pik certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the usda would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ascs prices cash grain dealers said byproduct of the soviet buying has been sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the midwest to the export terminals cash dealers said freight from upper areas of the mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price the mild winter and early reopening of the mid mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted the higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings they said the gulf market overreacted to the soviet buying reports which indicate the ussr has booked over two and perhaps as much as mln tonnes of corn one midwest cash grain trader said but dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the midwest river system

fed drafts currency rate swap risk gauge the federal reserve board voted unanimously to propose formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with new capital standard for banks that takes into account the riskiness of bank loans and other assets fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the bank of england the fed set 60 day period for public comment on the plan the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments previously the fed jan proposed series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off balance sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each level of risk that would establish bank minimum capital needs the additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for bank current exposure for given asset and the potential future exposure the current exposure would be measured by the mark to market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the bank of england and banking regulators future exposure would rise over the life of the asset the fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity they ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities they cautioned the fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of banks to compete in world financial markets however the staff concluded the credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations the fed proposal would exempt all but the 20 25 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges governor martha seger said she was concerned that japan was not involved in the effort to draft new capital rules

bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by news conference at around 1030 gmt but bundesbank officials noted that news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in 50 70 pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at minimum bid rate of 50 pct allocating funds at 55 pct they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted diplomatic gesture before next week venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further the bonn government will be in very weak position in venice because they can risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst hutmann bethmann chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy but don expect any convincing measures he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 60 70 pct from 75 85 yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june 15 two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 55 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 50 pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than 55 that would not represent tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes

lawson happy with sterling backs latest rate cut chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today announcement of further half point cut in british bank base lending rates to 10 pct however he said he wanted to see gradual approach to declines in domestic interest rates although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly he told briefing of economic journalists that don think we should rush anything lawson stressed the themes of gradualism and steadiness as economic policy lawson acknowledged that today fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987 88 unveiled yesterday to parliament and which set lower target for the key public sector borrowing requirement psbr of pct of gdp lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines were perfectly consistent with monetary conditions now in britain he supported that by saying the narrow m0 money supply aggregate was safely inside its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986 87 and 1987 88 in his budget lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling m3 turning to the question of britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system ems lawson repeated that it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election he said britain was keeping the subject of full ems membership under constant review but he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government prime minister margaret thatcher late last year said decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the economy but she later said such move depended on other ems countries scrapping residual capital controls although lawson denounced what he said was the current wave of election fever in britain he added it is more likely that there will be an election this year than not he said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air ideally we the government should have full term but events could force premature poll lawson said the government which has been in power since 1979 must call an election by june 1988 speculation is rising for either june or an early autumn election political sources said the decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987 88 was the right balance economically and politically he said lawson decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two pence surprised many analysts who had predicted that with treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move but it was being praised today by political analysts as shrewd move which while advancing towards that aim could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the psbr had undershot his original assumption of billion stg for 1986 87 by some three billion stg returning to changing levels of interest rates lawson stressed that they are not an objective for the government they are an instrument of policy consequently the treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels he said but there may be interest rate consequences from changes in the level of government borrowing he added lawson said he did not think that the relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in britain he said conditions created by london role as leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in britain lawson said first control of credit in britain rested on interest rates alone due to the freedom of its financial markets he said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition labour party thirdly he said we do not have as long track record of low inflation as did the japan and west germany lawson foresaw london becoming the world pre eminent financial centre because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than new york or tokyo

money data may ease rate cut analysts say slower than expected growth in britain narrow m0 money supply measure in february will help spur further cut in interest rates if surge in sterling value requires such move economic analysts said m0 the only targeted money supply measure left after chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling m3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on tuesday fell an adjusted to one pct in february on an annual basis this put m0 growth at four to pct in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct the m0 data are much better than we expected said robert thomas economist at greenwell montagu securities he and other analysts said while the better than expected m0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger new interest rate cut they removed an obstacle to such move thomas noted the rise in m0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in february advancing an adjusted pct after fall of the same size in january analysts said the m0 measure reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates the authorities still seem to want to pretend that m0 is important in practice it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune lloyds merchant bank chief economist roger bootle wrote in budget comment richard jeffrey economist at stockbrokers hoare govett said in comment it is unlikely that lawson will respond to signals from m0 alone reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken with the chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable the city has been forced to take it seriously he added noting this point thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an m0 overshoot had now disappeared this removed potential obstacle to further cut in base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets analysts said such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the group of five and canada at their paris meeting last month they added base rates have been cut twice by half point since the paris agreement once on march 11 and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget they stand at 10 pct now and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half point in the coming week analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant higher than expected increase in february sterling m3 which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct thomas said the february figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling m3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on march 31 some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling m3 target and lawson move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as key factor in monetary policy

further declines in debt futures possible after an already steep fall in the past week interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term financial analysts said however some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold and the contracts on long term debt could stage recovery before resuming their decline key to the near term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar they said as the dollar goes so goes the bond market said dean witter analyst karen gibbs the recent decline in the dollar which hit 40 year low against the japanese yen monday was reversed wednesday when several large money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by quarter point to pct even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over gibbs said the dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about pickup in inflation indeed the falling dollar may have been key topic at the meeting of the federal reserve policy making arm the federal open market committee this week analysts said to the fed the combination of falling dollar steepening yield curve and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation said denis karnosky analyst at carroll mcentee and mcginley inc such expectations could mean that shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration at the fomc meeting he said any such restriction of reserves will not be highly visible form of monetary tightening karnosky said rather the key to detecting change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window he said borrowings have held near weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months he said in the meantime however the market looks bit oversold said jim wysoglad analyst at golden gate futures wysoglad said recovery from the oversold condition could drive june bonds to high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97 13 32 technician leslie keefe of technical data corp of boston said that the key test for june bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96 24 32 all previous selloffs since mid november have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level keefe said if that level is broken and the dollar continues to decline keefe said she expects the june bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93 the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984

urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan the is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy reagan administration official said the official comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october 1985 washington outlined debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played key role in developing the debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for new loan of 15 billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was suitable way to go fine don think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it quite unique and don think it something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall 27 billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation development until now unacceptable to the banks it no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines

sterling outlook clouded by test of paris accord the move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the paris currency accord has thrown into question the near term outlook for sterling until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement analysts said since the six nation accord last month sterling has risen sharply adding almost five pct on its trade weighted index while the accord effectively stifled dollar yen and dollar mark movements the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high interest rates but analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the paris accord seen yesterday the market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in test of the willingness of central banks to intervene analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively the paris accord could collapse on balance sterling would be net sufferer if collapses phillips and drew analyst stephen lewis said he said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies however although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling none were expecting very sharp drop in the currency sterling remained supported by optimism on the political and economic outlook firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates they said bullish sentiment on the economic outlook has been running especially high after last week budget seen as popular both with the markets and with british voters sterling was also supported by signs of weakening in the west german and japanese economies where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the recent opinion polls showing britain ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound in addition sterling has so far shrugged off two half point cuts in bank base lending rates in less than two weeks further half point cut widely expected in the next week or so has already been largely discounted base rates now running at 10 pct are still relatively high compared to other western countries and analysts said further base rate cut to pct was unlikely to affect sterling sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar decline dropping only slightly on cross rate basis worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets however were reflected in the government bond gilt market where prices dropped by up to 16 point until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this thursday current account figures for february market forecasts are for deficit of around 250 mln stg after january small surplus

markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today turmoil in the financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar wake is evidence of major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar decline as the cure all for the trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker often repeated warnings about the risks of dollar collapse volcker been saying for long time that dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he got it said david jones economist at aubrey lanston and co inc the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to 1987 high of 432 20 70 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by 33 points to 2339 norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it difficult to stop there stark possibility that you could get destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 47 marks and 264 yen in february 1985 could turn into nightmare we re still more or less on track for hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to recession the stock market reaction today and its sharp drop on march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast drop to about 125 yen marris felt that major impetus for the dollar latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is substantial increase in the discount rate and corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968 69 will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said

dutch official rate cut seen still likely cut of about half percentage point in dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on bundesbank moves speculation has been rife that the dutch central bank encouraged by strong guilder mark relationship and wide premiums for dutch money and capital market rates over german might lower rates without the bundesbank moving first last month the central bank lowered its special advances rate to pct from 25 pct after the bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 55 pct from pct that rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings given strong guilder further fall in the west german repo rate would trigger lower special advances tariff forcing an official dutch rate cut analysts said in february when the bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from pct the central bank only lowered money market rates and removed surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota since then however both the central bank and finance ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates in april central bank president wim duisenberg said he would follow any bundesbank cut and last week the finance ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 25 billion guilders with six pct coupon state loan priced at 100 10 pct for an effective yield of 98 pct the lowest since 1965 technically analysts said there has to be difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market bank economists and dealers said west german move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the central bank easing the special advance rate provided the guilder mark relationship permitted the central bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the european monetary system of 112 673 guilders per 100 marks today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112 705 guilders per 100 at the fix level that would not permit change in the interest rate differential between west germany and the netherlands dealers said an economist at abn bank said he expected west german and dutch interest rates to ease in the short term however he said new wage agreements in west germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term in the netherlands the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to falling rate of economic growth it will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the abn economist said he said dutch money supply growth which ran at pct in january could also contribute to some inflation at amro bank leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year the bank expects dutch capital market rates currently averaging around pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around pct analysts said an official rate cut could trigger buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down probably only temporarily while money rates could fall below five pct currently all periods are traded at 12 to 25 pct in the money market

new bank rules tougher than needed dealers say and bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the bank of england and the federal reserve board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine while no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement separately the isda estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding kenneth mccormick co chairman of the international swap dealers association isda and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc said that the association has no comment and will study the proposals what they are proposing is really double counting patrick de saint aignan managing director of swaps for morgan stanley and co said instead he argues banks should either be required to hold percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of counterparty default the potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said director at one merchant bank what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he added adds title first paragraph dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in japan will have competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements federal reserve board governor martha seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the fed said she is concerned that japan was not involved in the effort to draft new capital rules dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to single counterparty against each other the paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk furthermore the paper said if netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design one problem is that there has never been major default in the swaps market so we don know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official

lawson remarks dash hopes of early rate cut chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling dashing hopes for an early cut in base rates analysts said but the market reaction testing exchange rate levels indicated by lawson was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed in an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy lawson told national economic development council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels specifying rates of around 90 marks and 60 dlrs lawson added the government intended to keep sterling at about present levels using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this the february 22 paris agreement of the group of five and canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these markets were quick to react to the statement chopping about one cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by lawson but most analysts polled said they did not believe lawson statement signalled change in policy keith skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers james capel and co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion lawson is paying now for little bit of slip of the tongue barclays de zoete wedd economist mark brett said there is nothing great and fantastic in the chancellor statement he said he did not believe the rates indicated by the chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate perhaps by as much as 10 pct it would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election don believe lawson is mad enough to tie himself to fixed rate brett said currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the paris accord and reactivate currency trading this mood easily led to over reaction analysts said making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps mistake one senior dealer with bank said capel skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at it is obvious that the government as member of the group of six has agreed exchange rate bands but they are not cut in stone they can change with time skeoch said brett said we think the 90 marks level is central rate give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks however chris dunn economist at royal bank of canada said the remarks may signal decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar although about two thirds of britain trade is conducted with european countries sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted britain must decide whether it wants to follow the or throw in its lot with europe dunn said it suggests that while the is not actually applying to join the european monetary system it is seeking protection by shadowing it the bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the to clarify its position relative to the mark he said analysts said sterling dip on currency markets following lawson remarks made an early half point cut in base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term over the next three weeks cut is out unless we get some extremely good economic indicators capel skeoch said base rates have been cut twice by one half point in march the last after the march 17 budget presentation and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards

german government needs seen raising bond yields increased federal government borrowing needs and growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say at the moment we have sideways movement in the short term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners one portfolio manager for large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried 10 year maturity coupon of six pct and price of 100 to yield 97 pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had pct coupon priced at 99 pct for yield of 75 pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said it isn more it just the size of each bond which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than 18 billion marks the government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986 but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26 billion the sources said this indicated move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government tax reduction program would also reduce income next year the problem here will be the tax reform the portfolio manager said he added that the government cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise total 43 billion marks through the issue of fixed rate medium term kassenobligation notes finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only net 22 billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect would expect the efforts for further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank public authority bond yield calculation falling to 64 pct on friday from 66 week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark the demand wasn so good dealer for german bank in london said the dollar recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently some dealers said

britain agree further bank capital proposals the bank of england and the federal reserve board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets the bank of england said the plan covering swaps forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates complements proposals agreed in january between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the and britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy the proposal said it said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until april 16 to comment on the trunk proposals the bank of england and fed said they had faced dilemma on the one hand we are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure on the other hand we are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of and banking organisations to price contracts competitively at the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so called credit equivalent amount the current value of currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures in treatment similar to that agreed in january for balance sheet assets the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct depending on the quality of the counterparty the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract the plans showed the proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts they would however be reflected in the assignment of risk weights the only guarantees recognised are those given by and governments or in the by domestic national government agencies the proposals showed the paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges it said regulatory authorities and the bank of england were keen to encourage banks to net contracts consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream it recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account the paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges it said regulatory authorities and the bank of england were keen to encourage banks to net contracts consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream it recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account

analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise economists said that they doubt the federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period wednesday borrowings were billion dlrs as federal funds averaged high 45 pct one could make case that the fed is firming but it probably isn said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two weeks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two week period included quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn quite make it said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets fed spokesman told press press conference today that the fed had no large net one day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday still mccarthy said it may have had cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around billion dlrs they put wednesday overnight system repos at approximately billion dlrs it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time said larry leuzzi of warburg and co inc citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said mccarthy of merrill lynch he said the dollar staged precipitous drop as new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to weekly average fed funds rate between six and pct this is about where the rate has been since early november not so sure that the fed is engineering tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said sullivan of dean witter if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 25 to 35 pct from six to 10 pct previously

fed seen content with february economy february reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the federal reserve will continue to follow stable course of monetary policy economists said if you re the fed there no reason to do anything said steve slifer of lehman government securities inc there are hints that gnp is picking up on the inflation front all is well he said money supply is well under control it an absolutely ideal situation february industrial production rose pct slightly less than the pct gain the financial markets had expected this compared with slim pct rise in january production number previously reported as pct increase the february producer price index gained only pct less than pct expected rise this followed pct rise in the ppi in january the fed is going to look at this positively said allan leslie of discount corporation certainly inflation is not as bad as what volcker fed chairman has said lately industrial production growth is along the lines of what the fed wants the energy products component of ppi rose pct in february after pct increase in january this shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said maria ramirez of drexel burnham lambert inc the trend is still pct in the first half of the year in 1986 declining energy prices contributed to pct decline in the ppi economists said that rise in energy prices was expected but sharp drop in auto prices was not passenger car prices fell pct and light truck prices dropped pct yesterday federal reserve chairman paul volcker said that possibility of renewed inflation remains concern in both the financial markets and the federal reserve the fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said robert brusca of nikko securities international while low inflation permits the fed to maintain an easier monetary policy brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate weaker dollar the outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said we need inflation for producers to compete with foreign producers brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped pct in february ppi with many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for competitiveness he said if further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in debt brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices by contrast slifer said imported goods prices rose 11 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to large degree 22 pct drop in the trade weighted real value of the dollar from february 1985 to february 1987 slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect weaker dollar david wyss of data resources inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising industrial output it the other side of the lower dollar wyss said producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of pct in the first quarter it an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive but stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc was not convinced that the february reports portend economic gains he said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to sustained rise in industrial output roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for one pct rise in february business equipment production utilities output rose pct in february after gaining pct in january but roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to million units at an annual rate from million units in the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly seven mln unit rate roach said the disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories economists pointed to sharp rise in january business inventories as sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 january business inventories rose pct the largest gain since july 1979 when inventories rose pct the commerce department said business sales dropped pct in january the largest monthly sales drop on record nonetheless economists do not expect the fed to react to month to month changes the fed has been standing pat for the last seven months ramirez said they will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months

lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages more lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the they were the mainstay of the business in the up until only few years ago but in the early 1980s interest rates soared lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts as result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds we very much have the example of the thrifts in mind said spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year the 100 mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just few days according to spokeswoman everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumption that conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years

no reason to cut rates bundesbank schlesinger bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that further cut in interest rates was needed the economy is picking up after contracting by seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview concerned by the first quarter downturn the has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in 1986 year on year growth was thus about two pct he estimated that economic growth for the year as whole would probably be between one and two pct it is not question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the bundesbank three to six pct target he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows heavy inflows particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation boosted domestic money supply there is still certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be little bit reversed schlesinger said major reason for the inflows was the market conviction that the mark was headed higher as we can see from the market expectations for further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished schlesinger said the recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said asked if central banks might act to prevent sharp dollar rise as the did in march when the dollar rose above 87 marks he said this would depend on the circumstances at midday here the dollar stood at 8340 45 marks central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but cannot give any answer how they would react schelsinger said one has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding it is not only our own case it is also the american case he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now but it wouldn be good to have short term fluctuations he said let us wait and see it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in very short period which was little bit of shock than the level of rates as such schlesinger said the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had favourable impact on west german inflation down year although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for possible eventual resurgence of inflation the above target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the bundesbank council schlesigner said but he added don see any great pressure to go away from it

poehl says rate rises are cause for concern rises in west german and international interest rates are cause for concern and the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates bundesbank president karl otto poehl said we consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be problem and cause for concern poehl told an investment conference would like to stress that the bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates he said shortly after poehl spoke the bundesbank announced tender for securities repurchase pact at fixed rate of 80 pct previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 85 pct at last week pact from 60 on the last fixed rate tender in late september the bundesbank reduction of the key allocation rate to 80 from 85 pct was heralded monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 70 and 80 pct these moves to cap interest rates followed meeting between poehl finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and treasury secretary james baker monday in frankfurt officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the louvre accord on currency stability over the weekend criticism by baker of the tightening in west german monetary policy had prompted sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that louvre cooperation had ended but the dollar rallied on news of monday meeting in nervous trading to trade above 79 marks tuesday poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy but to markets expectations and currency developments commenting on the inflationary expectations poehl said you have to get to the root of the problem you have to pursue policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears the inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated he said poehl rebuffed recent criticism of west germany saying the bundesbank had made substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy the bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target arousing criticism from other quarters he said today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986 quite the contrary of other countries where interest rates have risen substantially more poehl said this had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the german market he said poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the deficits the adjustment process in the trade balance is definitely underway he said noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures the spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention he said
german banks see low interest rates continuing the association of german cooperative banks said in financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being it said the bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest straining factors in the economy that could affect the long term capital market the inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates but probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for rise in nominal rates at year end and next year it said the association said generally low interest rates prospects of lower taxes stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth the bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long term capital market which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy it said in view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer term capital market the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through short term and expansionist monetary policy on the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987 the association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments the bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions it said

analysts say budget points to base rate cuts chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts if slightly lacking in excitement cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow with most forecasts predicting half point fall follow up half point cut is anticipated next week worthy but boring would probably sum it up peter fellner economist at stockbrokers james capel and co said it was very very prudent fiscal budget richard jeffrey of brokers hoare govett said it was well balanced budget within the confines of the government philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat most analysts said the budget was very sound on the fiscal side but offered nothing new on monetary policy as was widely expected lawson split his fiscal adjustment between trimming the 1987 88 psbr target to billion stg from billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct the target for the narrow measure of money supply m0 was kept unchangd at two to six pct while the target for the broad sterling m3 aggregate was dropped both jeffrey and fellner said the budget clears the way for half point fall in base rates tomorrow but the authorities are unlikely to sanction larger cut immediately many analysts and currency dealers have forecast full one point cut tomorrow the bank of england will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later jeffrey said though he added further half point cut was quite possible in the near future the main worry from today speech is the outlook for inflation given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it scrimgeour vickers economist richard holt said holt noted the rather loose inflation forecast of pct at end 1987 and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern higher psbr target could be preferable in the long term he said although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation the budget will inspire lot of short term confidence but it was not good budget for inflation he said jeffrey said he would have liked lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build up but overall was not too concerned about revival of inflation fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the leading edge of monetary policy but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front he said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness most analysts agreed lawson had bolstered the credibility of the budget by adopting realistic forecasts raising the forecast for the current account deficit from to billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets which are already discounting that amount jeffrey said that the billion stg psbr target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986 87 which is now also forecast to be billion stg but analysts said the budget speech did not give any clear cut indication about the timing of the general election which has to be held before june 1988 some believe it signals poll this june noting that the benefits such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco become available immediately but others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it james capel fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no chickens coming home to roost richard jeffrey who favours the likelihood of june election said it was important the chancellor had not gone for budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory nevertheless he said it was likely to result in boost to the conservative party pre election popularity

german financial policy makers in rare dissension karl otto poehl head of west germany central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank independence but rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued statement rebutting poehl criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through particularly difficult time there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october that the government was planning 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said poehl is in minority in his own house said commerzbank pfister poehl is in dilemma he must follow policy that is not entirely his own said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow revival of the 1986 war of words between the and west germany in which officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with local political row which has turned into the country worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out row in the northern state of schleswig holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl cdu led coalition government gave poehl another eight year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank independence of government chrobok said

german bond yields seen falling in near term west german bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month paris pact extend to keeping down european interest rates banking economists said but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany economy they said the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in and foreign interest rates salomon bros inc said in recent study it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was major factor in the dollar fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline it not taboo peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank average yield of public paper is already nearing last year low last week yields fell to around 50 pct not far from the 1986 low of 35 pct posted in mid april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer term paper such move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet demands for faster west german growth this move may force interest rates up by creating revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo institut said in newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn tax reform package the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by billion marks to 14 billion west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed large 21 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14 billion in fourth quarter 1985 the federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such credit in the 1985 quarter

kaufman says greenspan nomination bad for bonds henry kaufman managing director of salomon brothers inc said the nomination of economist alan greenspan to replace federal reserve board chairman paul volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets the basic direction of interest rates is not changed the fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward interrupted by intermittent rallies kaufman said in statement he said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish kaufman said unlike paul volcker who entered the office of the federal reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally mr greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the economy while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited kaufman noted consequently although he is well known abroad his views on issues such as the less developed country debt may initially carry less weight than have those of mr volcker

bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of imports and sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said reduction in the current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in 1986 koehler said if further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the when selecting monetary policy instruments central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

banks likely to lift prime rates again soon major banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said in what was the first prime rate boost since mid 1984 most banks in early april lifted their rates quarter point to pct citing reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money that spread has narrowed again prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc brusca said quarter point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of percentage point he said that spread had averaged around percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said david jones of aubrey lanston and co we ve got fairly good chance of prime rate rise in the near future said allan leslie of discount corp based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see prime rate increase now said harold nathan economist at wells fargo bank however he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar he said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high prime rate rise could occur at any time fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep dollar drop could help rekindle inflation as the dollar fell to 40 year low against the yen friday currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar in addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the currency would be for the fed to push interest rates higher relative to overseas rates based particularly on the fed reserve management actions on friday and today nathan of wells fargo said it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed bank funding costs and other short and long term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected on friday the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 16 pct with funds trading even higher at pct today the fed arranged only slightly larger billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements the fed actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said jones of lanston the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar jones said he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have major impact on the dollar the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from pct jones said discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar given likely fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30 year treasury bonds about 30 pct now and the prime rate may be at pct at end june and nine pct by year end the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said leslie of discount corp he said tax date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy

fed data indicate no policy change likely bank reserve monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the federal reserve today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be changed for weeks or even months economists said the fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy said john williams of bankers trust co these numbers contain no hint that policy shift is in prospect nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change said william griggs of griggs and santow inc fed data released today were all in line with economists expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks the fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs up from 381 mln dlrs in the february 25 statement period but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that it said that banks net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously finally the fed said that the money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in february with the broader measure down billion dlrs and up an even three billion dlrs analysts said that last month grew at negative pct annual rate compared with minus pct for and actual positive growth of pct annualized for february levels of and left the aggregates 18 and 20 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the fed for 1987 the annual growth target for both is to pct there is no target in the near term there is absolutely no reason for the fed to ease policy even apart from the slowdown in money growth said stephen slifer economist at lehman government securities inc economists generally expect modest pickup in monetary growth in march after february anemic growth rates however they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness commenting on february decline in the key aggregate slifer said the main cause was billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks this number has risen three to four billion dlrs month for long while he said so february weakness is not likely to persist slifer expects modest and growth rates of to four pct during march griggs said that and in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the fed economists said the fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves given the economy fragility in many sectors the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the fed will choose to raise rather than lower interest rates when it next changes policy discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the fed can get them although fed funds held above six pct said williams of bankers trust funds averaged 12 pct in the week to wednesday up from 06 pct in the prior week the fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last friday billion dlrs on monday and two billion dlrs on wednesday on tuesday it added reserves directly through two day system repurchases williams and griggs agreed the fed will let the funds rate be largely market driven they said it is focusing instead on borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs

tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have major deflationary impact on the real economy they said although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise fears of rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said but today stock market collapse prices fell nearly 15 pct means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely rumoured discount rate increase senior government economist suggested that both the and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices they need to support the stock and security markets he said but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was few months ago with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said there will be some impact on the real economy but it won be that big said another individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said paradoxically it is the pick up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said that will at least take couple of days if not weeks he said

brazil gros to meet banks on trade line issue brazil central bank governor francisco gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt bankers said gros will meet representatives of citibank the head of brazil bank advisory committee and of co heads morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc high on the agenda will be banks complaints about brazil accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short term trade and interbank lines the bankers said brazil several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last march to extend the credit lines until march 31 1987 as part of 31 billion dlr financing package bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment coupled with brazil freeze raised spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with gros they said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank this means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another the requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest rate spreads because foreign banks would rather accept reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank it caused lot of ill will with the banking community one banker said gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of 10 day tour of europe and japan that he and finance minister dilson funaro have just completed to seek official support for brazil debt stance

housing data fail to clarify economic path surprisingly strong housing statistics for february cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates but economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months and after steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom housing starts rose pct in february to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 851 mln units from 804 mln in january it was the highest pace for starts since april 1986 the rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed pct to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 764 mln units after dropping 11 52 pct to 690 mln in january february weather is usually more adverse for home building because of seasonal factors it difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road said allan leslie of discount corp the housing report is seasonally weighted to compensate for weather related setbacks as result milder temperatures inflate the statistics economists said that low mortgage rates also were spur to building last month but several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring early summer builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying let do it now said mark obrinsky of the league of savings institutions in washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building but obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the economy he expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 50 pct fixed rate effective in february last november fixed rate mortgages were about 10 30 pct as expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single family sector the multi family area which typically represents rental units remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective january single family starts rose at pct annual pace to 317 mln units multi family fell pct to 534 000 rate strength in the single family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job but we re probably not looking at great deal of growth potential said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets mccarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in employment industrial output and retail sales in february may cause some observers to start waving four pct gnp banners for the first quarter gross national product grew pct in the fourth quarter but mccarthy who still expects first quarter real gnp to come in at an annual rate of pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future the big story is the inventory re building that going on now not all of which is intentional he said for example automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of mln units in february compared with domestic car sales of mln thus while inventories could contribute to gnp in the first quarter they may result in scaled back production and weaker growth in the second he said if most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter agreed allan leslie of discount corp he is still evaluating first quarter gnp prospects federal reserve chairman paul volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed at the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second cautioned joe plocek of mccarthy crisanti and maffei inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct

fed policy ease may end with 2nd qtr rate cut the federal reserve move to easier monetary policy begun with four quick half point discount rate cuts in 1986 will likely end with final rate drop in the second quarter analysts said poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower with the fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from pct late next quarter to help the economy the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without full blown recession said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be quarter point drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter point drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the april june quarter follow the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of large budget deficit and wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollar steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs barrel and could well test the lower end of that range stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and modest second half economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around pct this year from pct in 1986 the sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will mild economic pickup in the second half of this year real gross national product which grew at two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half should expand at respective rates of about pct and pct in the 1987 first and second halves first quarter growth is put at pct annual rate slowing to pct next quarter robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed he expects real gnp which grew at pct rate in fourth quarter 1986 to expand at pct rate this quarter and pct next quarter the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to first quarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later we re running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said philip braverman of irving securities corp his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees 10 pct end of june yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 50 and seven pct respectively nikko brusca projects rates of 25 pct for bonds 15 pct for funds and 75 pct for the prime rate two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar fall to 40 year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending trade sanctions against japan david resler of nomura securities co international inc raised his end june bond yield forecast to 50 pct from 20 pct and fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 80 pct raul nicho president of money market services inc lifted his forecast of bond and fed funds rates an eighth of point to eight pct for bonds and pct for funds both nicho and resler left their end june prime rate forecast at pct the higher rate forecasts reflected belief that japanese investors will be less eager to buy bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to trade sanctions yields may have to rise to lure other buyers end june interest rate forecasts bonds fed funds prime nikko securities 25 15 75 money mkt services 00 25 50 discount corp 75 25 50 merrill lynch 30 75 50 bankers trust 25 50 50 wells fargo bank 30 60 00 irving securities 10 50 00 dean witter 00 50 00 forecast average 50 875 50 current levels 80 125 50

analysts see slow move to higher prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve policy intentions economists said based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but no rush is likely said paul mcculley of hutton and co citibank surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is strong chance of prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12 pct after fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting pct prime rate since last august 26 27 when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august 20 the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be split prime for while with some posting pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today coupon pass said joseph liro of warburg and co in move that came day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with 153 basis point average in 1986 reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present clear need for prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today prime rate rise may have been less response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds traded between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it stabilizes near there banks may not quickly boost their prime rates but consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar then banks would lift prime rates quickly

sterling outlook clouded by test of paris accord the move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the paris currency accord has thrown into question the near term outlook for sterling until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement analysts said since the six nation accord last month sterling has risen sharply adding almost five pct on its trade weighted index while the accord effectively stifled dollar yen and dollar mark movements the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high interest rates but analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the paris accord seen yesterday the market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in test of the willingness of central banks to intervene analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively the paris accord could collapse on balance sterling would be net sufferer if collapses phillips and drew analyst stephen lewis said he said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies however although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling none were expecting very sharp drop in the currency sterling remained supported by optimism on the political and economic outlook firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates they said bullish sentiment on the economic outlook has been running especially high after last week budget seen as popular both with the markets and with british voters sterling was also supported by signs of weakening in the west german and japanese economies where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the recent opinion polls showing britain ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound in addition sterling has so far shrugged off two half point cuts in bank base lending rates in less than two weeks further half point cut widely expected in the next week or so has already been largely discounted base rates now running at 10 pct are still relatively high compared to other western countries and analysts said further base rate cut to pct was unlikely to affect sterling sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar decline dropping only slightly on cross rate basis worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets however were reflected in the government bond gilt market where prices dropped by up to 16 point until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this thursday current account figures for february market forecasts are for deficit of around 250 mln stg after january small surplus

german banking authorities weigh swap regulations german banking authorities are weighing rules for banks off balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the and to japan juergen becker director of the bundesbank division of banking law and credit supervision said the british proposals were interesting but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages one representative of the german banking association in cologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank west germany four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require revision of germany credit law which has been in effect since 1934 authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks lending to 18 times shareholders equity plus reserves on consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and interest swaps commercial paper programs currency options interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges the sources said the main value of the proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk british proposals include complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous this is the so called market to market value but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks securities portfolios are zero for public authorities 20 pct for domestic banks 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non bank borrowers further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the and the may put german banks at competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of version of the proposals could far exceed the intent of the and british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said long dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as cross currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead manage mark eurobonds but as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added

africa financial rand seen headed higher the financial rand widely viewed as direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in south africa appears headed above 30 cents dealers and bank economists said the currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29 50 cents due partly to signs of possible power shift with the appearance of number of independent candidates in the whites only election on may they added it has risen about two cents this week alone another factor is that banks in london where the main market is based are going long in the currency because of general feeling that it will rise in the future one economist said dealers described 30 cents as psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after brief consolidation phase from recent gains after reaching 30 cents there is chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks one dealer said there was widespread feeling that both the commercial rand holding stable at 48 cents and the financial rand were staying firm banking sources said barclays national bank executive who asked not to be identified said the rise of the independents appears to be indicative of potential shift of power in the national party and has created favourable sentiment overseas one dealer said growing business and investor interest from west germany and switzerland were behind the financial rand rise economists said foreigners also were being attracted by south africa long term government bonds and semi gilts or securities in partly government owned firms many with yields as high as 30 pct they could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands this has had definite influence on the financial form of the rand dealer said adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply the financial rand was reintroduced in september 1985 to help end capital flight from south africa during period of severe political unrest in the country

new currency problem seen among europe japan the highly visible drama involving the yen sharp rise against the dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies thus creating new set of exchange rate distortions japanese and european research officials said the officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five industrial nations told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan trade axis into japan european community ec axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september 1985 new york plaza pact between the japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely you have to look at the dollar peak compared with now and that was well before plaza he said on february 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 263 15 yen on september 20 the friday before plaza it was 242 since then despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down yet the ecu is now around 173 yen the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story the european currencies are moving back up against the yen the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing in 1986 japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen this gave japan 16 billion dlr trade surplus last january japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the against about third in recent years trade with the in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the it is europe that is laying the golden egg said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from small base compared with total japan trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than firms factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries but therefore japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said azusa hayashi director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry if you want my objective view don expect drastic improvement in our trade imbalance last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said reuter

banks likely to lift prime rates again soon major banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said in what was the first prime rate boost since mid 1984 most banks in early april lifted their rates quarter point to pct citing reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money that spread has narrowed again prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc brusca said quarter point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of percentage point he said that spread had averaged around percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said david jones of aubrey lanston and co we ve got fairly good chance of prime rate rise in the near future said allan leslie of discount corp based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see prime rate increase now said harold nathan economist at wells fargo bank however he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar he said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high prime rate rise could occur at any time fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep dollar drop could help rekindle inflation as the dollar fell to 40 year low against the yen friday currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar in addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the currency would be for the fed to push interest rates higher relative to overseas rates based particularly on the fed reserve management actions on friday and today nathan of wells fargo said it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed bank funding costs and other short and long term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected on friday the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 16 pct with funds trading even higher at pct today the fed arranged only slightly larger billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements the fed actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said jones of lanston the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar jones said he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have major impact on the dollar the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from pct jones said discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar given likely fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30 year treasury bonds about 30 pct now and the prime rate may be at pct at end june and nine pct by year end the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said leslie of discount corp he said tax date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy

money data may ease rate cut analysts say slower than expected growth in britain narrow m0 money supply measure in february will help spur further cut in interest rates if surge in sterling value requires such move economic analysts said m0 the only targeted money supply measure left after chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling m3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on tuesday fell an adjusted to one pct in february on an annual basis this put m0 growth at four to pct in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct the m0 data are much better than we expected said robert thomas economist at greenwell montagu securities he and other analysts said while the better than expected m0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger new interest rate cut they removed an obstacle to such move thomas noted the rise in m0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in february advancing an adjusted pct after fall of the same size in january analysts said the m0 measure reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates the authorities still seem to want to pretend that m0 is important in practice it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune lloyds merchant bank chief economist roger bootle wrote in budget comment richard jeffrey economist at stockbrokers hoare govett said in comment it is unlikely that lawson will respond to signals from m0 alone reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken with the chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable the city has been forced to take it seriously he added noting this point thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an m0 overshoot had now disappeared this removed potential obstacle to further cut in base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets analysts said such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the group of five and canada at their paris meeting last month they added base rates have been cut twice by half point since the paris agreement once on march 11 and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget they stand at 10 pct now and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half point in the coming week analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant higher than expected increase in february sterling m3 which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct thomas said the february figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling m3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on march 31 some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling m3 target and lawson move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as key factor in monetary policy

paris meet agreed not to publish bands lawson chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies questioned by parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands lawson replied we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to when asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in paris lawson said do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement so as not to make it easy for speculation against the accord lawson said the paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors but if such movements were due to extraneous factors lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges it is clear that both germany and japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented just as it is taking time for the united states to make its own economy more export oriented lawson said in his oral evidence to parliament select treasury committee lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound current level adding that it is an objective to try to keep it around that level he said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully there has been reassessment of sterling fundamentals lawson said he disagreed with what he termed the grossly exaggerated claim that real interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries using as reference the key three month sterling interbank rate as quoted in london lawson said britain now had real interest rate level of 75 pct the same as japan did and only 75 percentaage point above the group of five average lawson confirmed that over the medium and longer term the government objective is zero inflation he said the government intention of its psbr constant at pct of gdp is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine he added that to allow the debt gdp ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply recipe for accelerating inflation

economic spotlight ems marks eighth birthday the european monetary system marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ecu has been runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe common currency took step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked second stage of development envisaged by the system founding fathers ex west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system greatest weakness its vulnerability to weak dollar over the past 18 months as the dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut interest rates to slow the mark rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still major world currency outside the system no change in the british government attitude is expected before the country next general elections due by mid 1988 meanwhile the system last realignment the 11th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank economic research department economists say the system fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict

fed data suggest no change in monetary policy new banking data suggest the federal reserve is guiding monetary policy along steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said but they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week unexpected eight billion dlr decline suggests it may this could influence the fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward more accommodative monetary policy reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced forecast of 600 mln dlr decline for the week ended june with estimates ranging from gain of one billion dlrs to decline of four billion instead fell eight billion dlrs to 745 billion dlrs at seasonally adjusted annual rate coming on the heels of billion decrease in for the week ended june this means the nation money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said has hit an air pocket of weakness said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc while may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth sullivan said fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates and which are seen as better gauges of economic growth latest monthly and data showed that as of may both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed to pct target ranges if money growth does not accelerate fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said does this mean that the fed abandons its current open market position no sullivan said but does this mean the end of tightening for the time being definitely yes economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two week bank statement period were lower than they had expected most believed the fed had targetted two week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs but they said that if it had not been for large one day net miss in the fed reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached drop in may housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the economy are lagging while recent modest pct gain in may producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears slifer said if this continues we can entertain the notion of fed easing at some point he said other economists said the fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth it has been number of years since has given good signs of what going on in the economy one said don think shows that the economy is falling apart and the fed should ease economists agreed stable dollar will continue to be prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary policy they said the fed is reluctant to lower short term rates for fear this would spur expectations of weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long term yields and choke off econmomic growth but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late april the fed has to determine if this represents fundamental change for the dollar if it does then this gives them more room to ease he said
bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of imports and sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said reduction in the current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in 1986 koehler said if further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the when selecting monetary policy instruments central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

economic spotlight dutch exchange rate policy recent slackness on dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the west german mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy while agreeing with the bank commitment to defend the guilder strongly some bankers want the bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the european monetary system ems roelof nelissen chairman of amsterdam rotterdam bank nv amro said the central bank policy was overcautious would like to suggest that the bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the ems nelissen said at the presentation of amro 1986 annual report last week within the ems the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110 1675 and 115 235 guilders per 100 the central bank maintains stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113 00 guilders per 100 it regards stable exchange rate as its main target using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate the preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the netherlands critics say the bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short rabobank nederland said in its latest economic bulletin by maintaining the 113 00 limit the central bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level if it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain amro nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the dutch capital market large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder mark exchange rate he added unlike amro algemene bank nederland nv abn says this is price the dutch have to pay it fully agrees with the central bank policy director general julien geertsema told reuters noting 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the ems hurt confidence in the dutch currency it is pity we need such wide interest rate difference between west germany to maintain the exchange rate he added interest rate differentials between west germany and the netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries as the economic performance of the two does not differ much economists said data on 1986 capital flows between west germany and the netherlands have not yet been released but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the dutch german chamber of commerce earlier this month economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates west germany is the netherlands largest single trading partner taking 28 pct of dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986 central bureau of statistics figures show at the moment the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around pct while the same deposits in guilders have rate of around 16 pct amro bank argues that the dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987 contrasting with slight inflation in west germany in the netherlands the cost of living is expected to decrease by pct at gnp growth rate of two pct the dutch central planning agency said in its 1987 forecast last month german gnp is seen rising by two to pct but with inflation between zero and pct according to most german forecasts but despite this upward push on real dutch rates money dealers do not expect the central bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the bundesbank following the west german interest rate cuts on january 22 the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the bank to follow suit unconditionally they said the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies the central bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow the european monetary system is not only relationship between the guilder and the mark many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of third currency central bank vice director jan hendrik du marchie sarvaas said if we allowed the guilder to become little cheaper the markets would start to believe it was weak we don want that we want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark he said

nigeria changes auction rules to defend the naira nigeria central bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as means of defending the naira currency which has depreciated steadily the bank said in statement that from april banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as presently at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction this should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september 26 at last week session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is central part of nigeria structural adjustment program which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in black africa the program involves setting realistic exchange rate for the naira which was over valued for many years liberalising imports boosting agriculture removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy the world bank has played prominent part in designing this dramatic blue print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards ishrat husain the world bank representative in nigeria said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as whole and the foreign exchange auctions so far so good he told meeting of bankers in lagos adding that only members of nigeria import dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect he said bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last september

spain to relax exchange controls the bank of spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put spanish banks on an equal footing with european community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions central bank spokesman said the measures to take effect by june were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations in line with deregulation in the banking industry he said in telephone interview the spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted broader package of reforms announced last friday the central bank said in statement the measures included increased provisions for high risk borrowers and provision for future pension fund obligations it said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate spain financial sector move triggered by entry into the community last year spain has five years to complete bank deregulation process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system lending assets residents in spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of billion pesetas against previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas the 750 mln peseta limit was set last march between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans the central bank spokesman said operations over billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding formerly obtainable through deposits by issuing certificates of deposit bonds and commercial paper they can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues while before they had to be converted into deposits foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency the central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans which previously were limited to three times bank capital equity the latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates the reserve requirement which was already in place on normal peseta deposits was intended to curb short term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government money supply growth target foreign banker said high reserve requirements which now account for about 30 pct of deposits placed spanish banks at disadvantage with european competitors the government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation the real problem is the freeing of interest rates the banker said this is going to take big bite out of profits the ruling lifted six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days the chairman of one of spain leading banks said the measure was expected to bring 20 pct drop in profits this year

think it is possible that there may be scope for further reduction in interest rates in germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such move was likely he made no mention of japanese interest rates lawson said the should embark on gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years he said the february 22 louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks and he was content with sterling exchange rate pointing to the record billion stg rise in may currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing very full part ourselves we have been intervening to very much greater extent than we had done hitherto lawson said there was risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro economic commitments underlying the accord certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris in this respect he said the budget deficit was very important noting the 000 billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports supply side measures are critical there is specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said lawson doubted that tokyo partners would indulge in japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years japan more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990 he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries on debt lawson said he expected three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub saharan countries to make progress in venice the plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions first it is blow for realism second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp he said banks should follow bank of england recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions they have done it to some extent they need to do it more lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit there is consensus which we have to push further
currency intervention timing crucial analysts the dollar recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said central banks may succeed in slowing trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said jim neill financial markets economist with marine midland banks inc the importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for week through open market intervention after citibank raised its prime rate by quarter point to pct the first change in the rate since last august the dollar started to advance and reached high in tokyo of 147 50 yen up two yen from tuesday new york low by contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the bank of japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of march but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing 40 year low monday of 144 70 yen some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just temporary battle to prop up the dollar the market is wary of being caught wrong footed by central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized they ve lost their credibility the market feels it can take on the central banks and win said michael snow head of treasury operations at union bank of switzerland in new york the relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the september 22 1985 plaza accord then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances now there is no such consensus the market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while japan is resisting in bid to protect its export industries for its part the united states is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the february paris agreement of the group of five plus canada to foster stability dealers say specifically they said the fed dollar buying intervention has been half hearted designed more as political gesture to japan than to strike fear into the markets it been pro forma intervention said francoise soares kemp chief corporate trader at credit lyonnais because of this discord and the market momentum for lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail it going to take lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation there have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it late last decade during the presidency of jimmy carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to record low of 70 marks analysts said snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely don think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market trading volume in london new york and tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs day according to joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the group of thirty private research group there are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide bank of japan sources told reuters in tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered in this era of financial liberalization it almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of japan one senior official in tokyo said

poehl warns against further dollar fall bundesbank president karl otto poehl said weaker dollar would be risky and further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit he said the united states could face vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful he said he said he shared some of the concern about japan trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said this was remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said but he said there was still danger that the correction of the dollar value could overshoot

economist urges more taxes to lower dollar an income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the dollar independent economist len bayliss said bayliss former economist with the reserve bank and the bank of new zealand said major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies the taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the dollar he said in speech he added that the deficit for the year ending march 1988 could be much higher than the government billion dlr forecast since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product major tax increase was probably unavoidable bayliss said he would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value added goods and services tax introduced in october 1986 but that would have had short term inflationary impact import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of currency depreciation the government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added new zealand inflation rate was 16 pct in the year to end september against 18 pct in the year to end june the major deficiency in the government anti inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit bayliss said the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit the widespread belief that new zealand problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based primarily because the government macro economic policies have been unsuccessful bayliss said

markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today turmoil in the financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar wake is evidence of major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar decline as the cure all for the trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker often repeated warnings about the risks of dollar collapse volcker been saying for long time that dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he got it said david jones economist at aubrey lanston and co inc the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to 1987 high of 432 20 70 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by 33 points to 2339 norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it difficult to stop there stark possibility that you could get destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 47 marks and 264 yen in february 1985 could turn into nightmare we re still more or less on track for hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to recession the stock market reaction today and its sharp drop on march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast drop to about 125 yen marris felt that major impetus for the dollar latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is substantial increase in the discount rate and corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968 69 will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said

dollar value appropriate bundesbank official says the dollar is near appropriate levels against european currencies and the yen and further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth top bundesbank official said board member leonhard gleske also told forex association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in medium term perspective he said the recent paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the group of five and canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability the paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level at present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies and the yen gleske said he said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as canada korea taiwan and hong kong and further falls there may still be necessary but further dollar depreciation against major european currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said in fact further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers gleske said first in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as japan and west germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses second in the united states it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits gleske said gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them for instance the reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones if target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities commenting on the paris currency accord gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained these chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot he said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said

lawson remarks dash hopes of early rate cut chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling dashing hopes for an early cut in base rates analysts said but the market reaction testing exchange rate levels indicated by lawson was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed in an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy lawson told national economic development council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels specifying rates of around 90 marks and 60 dlrs lawson added the government intended to keep sterling at about present levels using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this the february 22 paris agreement of the group of five and canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these markets were quick to react to the statement chopping about one cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by lawson but most analysts polled said they did not believe lawson statement signalled change in policy keith skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers james capel and co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion lawson is paying now for little bit of slip of the tongue barclays de zoete wedd economist mark brett said there is nothing great and fantastic in the chancellor statement he said he did not believe the rates indicated by the chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate perhaps by as much as 10 pct it would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election don believe lawson is mad enough to tie himself to fixed rate brett said currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the paris accord and reactivate currency trading this mood easily led to over reaction analysts said making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps mistake one senior dealer with bank said capel skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at it is obvious that the government as member of the group of six has agreed exchange rate bands but they are not cut in stone they can change with time skeoch said brett said we think the 90 marks level is central rate give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks however chris dunn economist at royal bank of canada said the remarks may signal decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar although about two thirds of britain trade is conducted with european countries sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted britain must decide whether it wants to follow the or throw in its lot with europe dunn said it suggests that while the is not actually applying to join the european monetary system it is seeking protection by shadowing it the bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the to clarify its position relative to the mark he said analysts said sterling dip on currency markets following lawson remarks made an early half point cut in base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term over the next three weeks cut is out unless we get some extremely good economic indicators capel skeoch said base rates have been cut twice by one half point in march the last after the march 17 budget presentation and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards

usx lt chairman calls for lower dollar usx corp chairman david roderick called for lower value for the dollar against other currencies to help speed correction in the trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs in remarks prepared for speech before the economic club of detroit roderick said there should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery roderick said the should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as result of falling dollar but he added as painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession roderick said between february 1985 and december 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations at the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the exceeded the value of assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the had surplus in assets of 141 billion company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to usx the primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved roderick said but it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to fundmental deterioration of productivity or of american product quality these areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem roderick said he urged american manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets in the speech the usx chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators among his proposals which he presented to the senate banking committee in testimony last week were requirement that raiders give 24 hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in company roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before tender is made further raiders should be required to make an all cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of target company stock he said and payment of greenmail or preferential price by target company to buy back raider stake should be prohibited under the revised laws roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers

doubts about accord seen weakening dollar further the dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates senior foreign exchange dealers said following its fall today to record 148 40 yen dealers said they expect the dollar to establish new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down the dealers said the recent remark by treasury secretary james baker that the paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast shadow on the agreement said koji kidokoro general manager of mitsui bank ltd treasury division he said the market interpreted this as indicating the would favour weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency this eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention kidokoro said dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that bank of japan intervention alone could hardly contain further slide in the currency they said the central bank bought between one to billion dlrs today including direct purchases through brokers and yesterday it might have bought small amount of dollars through the central bank in new york most dealers said they doubted the federal reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen if the dollar drops to that low level it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into securities which the americans don want said haruya uehara chief money market manager of mitsubishi trust and banking corp he said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986 87 business year ending on march 31 but dealers said the longer term outlook for the dollar remained bearish this was due to the lacklustre performance of the economy the continuing trade deficit and japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package the americans are getting frustrated at japan inertia in stimulating its economy said hirozumi tanaka assistant general manager of dai ichi kangyo bank ltd international treasury division in the paris currency accord japan promised package of economic measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and thus reduce its trade surplus the package was expected in april but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of sales tax in the circumstances the government had only slim chance of producing meaningful economic package in the near future dai ichi kangyo tanaka said dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar

german financial policy makers in rare dissension karl otto poehl head of west germany central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank independence but rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued statement rebutting poehl criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through particularly difficult time there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october that the government was planning 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said poehl is in minority in his own house said commerzbank pfister poehl is in dilemma he must follow policy that is not entirely his own said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow revival of the 1986 war of words between the and west germany in which officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with local political row which has turned into the country worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out row in the northern state of schleswig holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl cdu led coalition government gave poehl another eight year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank independence of government chrobok said

treasury baker under fire for wall street drop as official washington sought to restore investor confidence after monday wall street collapse treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis baker weekend blast at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretary statements helped spur wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy lawson told london television interviewer tuesday think the scale of the stock fall was very great that think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic it was dispute that should never have happened he added although baker appeared to patch over the rift at hastily called meeting with west german officials monday he still faced storm of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday baker cut short long planned trip to scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis said one analyst of baker weekend remarks his timing could not have been worse one government bond salesman in new york said he actually thought that yelling at the germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work that doesn show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship however some analysts said west germany stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced baker hand on the surface baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it unsettling of financial markets it was west german policy said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was little like killing the messenger he said after monday talks the and west german governments made it clear that the louvre currency accord pieced together in paris in february was still in effect wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be prelude to hyper inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s analysts believe monday wall street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values treasury sources said that baker already unhappy about bonn refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite he felt that the recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion growing economy has been serving as huge market for debtor country exports moreover baker the consummate politician was worried that the republican party might face next year presidential election with its main showpiece vibrant economy badly tarnished rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off economic growth that has already slowed to tepid pct annual rate there no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there ll be serious price to pay economically former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in television interview in many ways the official response was mild washington was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat with president reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact for all of this it seems unlikely that baker status in washington will diminish because of the market fall asked by reporters if somebody head should roll because of the wall street retreat texas democratic senator lloyd bentsen said with some irony oh think it much too late to be doing that you have an administration that taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and retire to the living room to take nap you just can do that

soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention that was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified for now the strategy appears to be working japanese officials said late last week package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early april until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon the reagan administration facing an uproar in congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169 billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from japan dramatic action is required last week the white house imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain japanese electronic goods after tokyo failed to adhere to semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries the shift in strategy in part designed to appease mounting congressional anger over japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the paris agreement to stabilize currencies and news that japan earned record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of officials nonetheless officials see signs of improvement in the deficit be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one in paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality the agreement envisages those fundamentals to include japan and west germany stimulating their economies and the united states cutting its budget deficit the three nations joined by france britain and canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances but analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply lower dollar rather than stable one markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures including budget deficit cuts agreed by congress and the white house will be carried out nonetheless the dollar sharp fall has not undermined cooperation economic policymaker said the accord was on track and tokyo and bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the paris accord calls for international monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although japan is an obvious exception everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments but last week the bank of japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs another monetary source said japan was upset with america half hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the paris accord outright the source close to the top levels of japanese economic policymaking said japan understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck the source said tokyo was extremely worried by washington use of the exchange rate to change japanese policies it was pointed reminder to japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar fall against the yen by departing last sunday from the language of the paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels baker triggered run on the dollar later in the week mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on japan and west germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth but officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the paris agreement there realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said while no one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another official said the officials said the

economy shows promising signs of growth the economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say some of the slowness experienced in the october december period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in january slowed business and consumer spending but some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook the commerce department reported today that new orders for durable goods in february jumped by billion dlrs six pct rise to 101 billion dlrs even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose healthy pct the agency said the february numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct the january february employment statistics suggest the gross national product will show healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said lyle gramley an economist with the mortgage bankers association the jobless rate in february and january was pct the lowest rate since march 1980 the number of new non farm jobs rose by 337 000 in february after 319 000 gain in january and 225 000 december increase the government said the employment data suggests gnp annual growth rate of about three to 25 pct in the first quarter said gramley much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter gramley said he expects slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending he also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi family housing units fidelity bank senior economist mickey levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue levy predicts gnp will grow at scant pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show brisk pct annual rate in the third quarter the key to both forecasts is marked improvement in the trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar value over the last year and half the improvement will be gradual and long lasting levy predicted most of it will be through import reduction but at least one third will be due to rise in product exports as the prices of goods become more attractive overseas the reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the economy will grow by respectable pct for the year compared with pct rate last year as part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the has been pressing west germany and japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the and others officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the united states whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries the economy provided them with giant market for their goods giving them way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt the government last week said the economy grew at modest pct annual rate during the fourth quarter there were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the united states and those shipped abroad the report showed rising volume of exports corresponding to decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 while fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped healthy pct during the period the government said it also reported that inflation as measured by the gnp price deflator remained in check growing moderate pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years the government also reported that consumer spending key element of the five year economic recovery jumped pct in february after falling two pct in january the federal reserve board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the economy was showing signs of recovery in its latest report on current economic conditions the fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except dallas where orders remained sluggish chase econometrics chairman lawrence chimerine said the pick up in the manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar value he said he does not foresee major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either he said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power that pattern is starting and will continue for number of years chimerine said he sees economic growth

fed chairman volcker says bank proposals worry the chairman of the federal reserve board paul volcker has written to the chairman of the house banking committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration wednesday volcker told committee chairman fernand st germain proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against firms abroad he added even japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed has started opening its markets in his letter made available at the treasury volcker also said proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was problem believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt volcker said it might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said volcker said he endorsed comments by treasury secretary james baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility he also said proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects for example the bill directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve competitive exchange rate for the dollar matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations volcker said he recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in paris between treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies

sprinkel urges greater growth in japan europe beryl sprinkel chairman of the president council of economic advisors said stronger domestic demand growth in japan and western europe is needed to help stimulate exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation he told the futures industry association sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in japan and europe has been one of the weakest in the post war period stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery he said asked if japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners he said recent figures showed japan economy grew by about pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 not enough to sustain employment growth however sprinkel said japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies including tax reform suspect there will be further moves he said sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in government spending and for resistance to tax increases reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform he said adding that vote to increase to government expenditures is vote against tax reform sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the trade balance appeared to have abated however he said that sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable as it risks inflation in the united states and recession abroad am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 he said improvements in the trade balance he said will come about largely from swing in manufactures trade and present serious adjustment problems for trading partners western europe where manufactures output and employment have been weak promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the trade balance sprinkel said he defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them

canada ties seen worse without trade pact canadian ties could worsen if the two nations are unable to reach free trade pact according to study published by two nonpartisan public policy research groups the cato institute of washington and the fraser institute of vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross border trade would benefit both countries but cato chairman william niskanen added the two nations generally harmonious trade relations are probably not sustainable without new agreement the united states and canada whose cross border trade totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year have been holding talks since last june on pact to end the few trade barriers remaining between their two countries the put deadline on the talks of october but both sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining remained niskanen said if no pact is reached bilateral trade ties could deteriorate because of congressional pressure on president reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively and this could hit some canadian trade practices he noted canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto industry which could put strains on the considerable bilateral free trade in and canadian autos and parts niskanen also said the canadian government is vulnerable to resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict exports to canada free trade pact backed by president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney would open new markets for canada and enable its industries to achieve economies of scale which would also help it widen exports worldwide he said it would also increase the gross national products of both countries niskanen said the goal of pact should be to end all tariffs within 10 years lower subsidies on exports set rules for trade in services and investments end curbs on government procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes

volcker warns against sizeable dlr decline federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth testifying before the senate banking committee volcker said that europe and japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing in that kind of situation further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive he said domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports volcker said on the value of the dollar volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade what we do know is that substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made he said that adjustment should be large enough in context of growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the united states to support the widespread expectations of narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead he said volcker said exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with minimum of inflationary pressure the united states would have to slow its spending growth it would also have to achieve better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital the constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit year by year paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts he said relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation he said
india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gap india is searching for non communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told reuters most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in 1984 comes from two state trading firms the state trading corp stc and the minerals and metals trading corp mmtc the two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indian exports commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading one trade source said india has targetted countries that depend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports however countertrade deals still make up only small part of india total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18 53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended december the sources said countertrade accounted for just five pct of india 25 65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985 86 ended march against almost nothing in 1984 85 official figures show however the figures exclude exchanges with the eastern bloc paid in non convertible indian rupees the sources said total trade with the soviet union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and crude oil is estimated at 04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986 87 against three billion in 1985 86 indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country large trade deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia venezuela and brazil the trade sources said the trade deficit which hit an estimated record 96 billion dlrs in 1985 86 is expected to decline to billion in the current fiscal year but the push to include non communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said one source said india is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break gatt rules as member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt india cannot officially support bartering the mmtc recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails mmtc recent global tenders now include clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to india trade official said adding that the policy remains flexible we also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to india the trade official said early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs and railway equipment to india that they stood better chance if they bought indian goods or services in return the trade sources said illustrating the point the official said south korean firm recently agreed to sell drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state run oil and natural gas commission in return the south koreans gave verbal assurance to buy indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract against the 25 pct sought by new delhi the trade official said we selected the korean firm because its bid was the lowest he added countertrade is helping african countries short of foreign currency to import goods india has signed trade protocol to buy up to 15 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from zimbabwe in exchange for indian goods including jute bags and cars but despite india new drive countertrade has some inherent problems they added it is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced one trade source said the other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants another added barter is also restrictive we look upon it as temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty this is why countertrade has not been made law in india it does not even figure in the country foreign trade policy

study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation swelling trade deficit government study said in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the economy it said the 218 page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to record 166 billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said although each industry competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s it also said it found fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries lack of investment in industry declining research and development in industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the 1970s and antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit

deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the trade deficit or buoy the economy the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs similarly the senate budget committee has approved plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year in terms of the economy 37 38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander touche ross federal budget policy analyst at best it will have small positive effect collander said in an interview federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar the government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar but volcker has warned that further fall in the dollar value is fraught with danger such decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit in addition in february officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce consumption particularly federal spending if you don deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten recession kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets there no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it not enough silvia told reuters the trade deficit has become one of the government most vexing and persistent problems the 1986 deficit was 169 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year end in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986 1991 period by last year gramm rudman balanced budget law while the new law set ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs for political reasons 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross collander to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained anything less than that will now look like failure to wall street the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year the senate budget committee has called for deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts

nakasone hard pressed to soothe anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in bid to defuse mounting anger over japanese trade policies but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans nakasone will be hard pressed to come up with anything new to tell president ronald reagan and key congressmen they said news of the week long visit starting april 29 coincided with news that japan recorded 14 billion dlr trade surplus last month more than 70 pct higher than year earlier it also came one day after the reagan administration economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up package of short term economic measures until after its 1987 88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to tacit admission that the budget was inadequate but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the virtually empty handed nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ldp to come up with its own measures he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said officials working on the government short term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment they said record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987 88 fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over 80 pct diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan who is under pressure from the democrat controlled congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit to complement the short term measures nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan longer term economic plans high ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor haruo maekawa is expected to come up with final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington its recommendations are designed as follow up to maekawa report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said while wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee recommendations subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan total output or gross national product around 1993 or 1995 last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and very gradual appreciation of the yen to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 from 150 now
japan cuts chip supply may produce shortage japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on japanese electronic goods set to take effect april 17 industry analysts said the move is likely to create sharp price rise and possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the japanese semiconductor industry analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs we ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for rams and it has virtually dried up for eproms said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching kurlack added industry analysts said japan ministry of international trade and industry or miti had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year semiconductor accord with the the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the market but some analysts said japan attempt to mollify the was double edged sword and might be read at subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the as production in japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured the japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from washington but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle analyst peck said the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit chip makers think this could be very important factor for semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said but analyst peck said it will take few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment
economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland economy and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided very useful excuse for under achieving they did have bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as theoretical projection based on high point which has no real scientific evaluation foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the in the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln as credits ran out poland has dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it an illusion based on misunderstanding of western economy there limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today reality describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has hard currency debt of 33 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the japan and europe would also hamper poland efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has moral right to assistance from the which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but western economist said the argument that sanctions were unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in short time and not without cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the had

oecd trade growth seen slowing in 1987 the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the economist intelligence unit eiu said the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to pct this year compared with pct growth forecast in december it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences and japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to pct from pct in december and to pct from three pct for japan it said it expected the oecd to post current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in large part to 50 dlrs barrel rise in 1987 oil prices it said the current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 it said it expected west germany to post 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan 76 billion dlr surplus this year the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16 50 dlrs barrel by end 1987 and 15 50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly ragged it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose further 13 pct on its trade weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year 18 pct drop the average mark dollar rate is put at 80 marks this year and 70 in 1988 while the yen dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said this is not crash scenario but the dollar steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with fireball rather than three point landing the eiu said talking will not stop the dollar slide for long and the february meeting of finance ministers of the group of five and canada produced scant promise of either decisive shift to more expansive policies in west germany and japan or tighter fsical policy it said it said the key to the dollar fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy government assets despite prospects of sustaining currency loss thus far they have been willing the eic said adding that if japan was deterred from buying bonds the dollar would collapse to contain such currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and third world debt crisis it said on trade the eiu said prospects for 1987 look increasingly sick import growth forecast in december at pct is now seen slowing down to around pct in 1987 with recovery only to pct in 1988 it said the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature sluggish pct growth in 1987 against the pct forecast in december the eiu said on the export side it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe while japan exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by exporters would respond only marginally to lower more competitively priced dollar it said in most of europe and in japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986

inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates roldan said the chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for country like brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had total value of around 23 billion dlrs but he added they are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels analysts said key factor in brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with vengeance negotiations between international coffee organization ico members to re establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence brazil would not tolerate change in ico regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said the dealer who declined to be named said brazil wanted to preserve its market share at the end of the talks he said brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy brazilian sales the dealer said if they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach dollar ninety or eighty cents he said new york coffee futures for may delivery settled 29 cents lower thursday at 104 68 cents lb while more distant deliveries fell the six cent maximum trading limit president of the brazilian coffee institute jorio dauster told press conference in rio de janeiro today that brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ico talks on export quotas many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped up brazilian marketing efforts they will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to richard loewy analyst for prudential bache securities inc loewy believes the foreign debt problem good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the brazil soybean crop brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can afford to store the crops he said the chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large south american crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields we are going to see very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our exports loewy said tommy eshleman economist for the american soybean association asa said this year brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 13 mln last year marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the crop to bad growing weather another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of reduction in the government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral eshleman said he said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan we re getting into period when they brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export eshleman said but he added it will be while before exports fall to below 10 mln bushels week from around 20 mln bushels currently jose melicias from the research department of drexel burnham lambert said brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation he said the debt situation was major consideration the brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added asked if return to an inflationary environment in brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops melicias said it would not make big difference on other commodity markets brazil selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital brazil is faced with poor 1986 87 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said the country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said brazil other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so don think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said if they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they can afford to do that she added
lyng opens japan talks on farm trade barriers agriculture secretary richard lyng opens talks with japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of japanese rice beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected but in an interview with reuters during the flight to tokyo yesterday lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on japan agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on tokyo to open its markets the japanese have said they are happy we are coming but they are not going to give us anything lyng said officials do not expect any japanese concessions during lyng two week visit here any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month they said if there is anything of consequence to offer prime minister yasuhiro nakasone would take it with him when he visits washington later in the month one official said lyng plans to ask japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases private rice trader visited tokyo last week requesting japan buy 200 000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake japan has rejected the overture saying tokyo maintains policy of self sufficiency in rice lyng will also press japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by april 1988 because he believes japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed he cited the example of california company which transports live cattle to japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota the cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal he said officials said the japan livestock industry promotion corporation which regulates beef imports was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and japanese beef prices were rising japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports along with beef the will also press japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by april 1988 some officials believe japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the japanese mandarin orange industry the quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice and japanese officials have said lyng has resurrected past proposal that japan buy surplus foodgrains for donation to developing countries but some officials are skeptical action will be taken lyng will also urge japan to put its domestic farm policies including rice on the negotiating table during gatt talks in geneva he said japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible reprisals

volcker says trade deficit is major challenge federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said the trade deficit is challenge for the equal to the soviet union launching of sputnik the international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of sputnik by the russians in the 1950s when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of soviet technological achievement he said in an address to florida educators he said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the educational system to improve economic performance the commerce department reported last week that the nation trade gap calculated on balance of payments basis swelled to record 38 37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter bringing the 1986 deficit to record 147 71 billion dlrs volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast changing economic climate volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low income minority groups such as blacks and hispanics

gatt warns on federal budget protectionism the united states emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and trade gatt said by stressing its record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year the was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only pct in 1987 full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and smaller federal budget deficit raising trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to low dollar risk of higher inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the had increased in 1986 the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was risk of sizeable increase in the inflation rate under the combined impact of rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986 about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing stagnant pattern in that sector this decade gatt said developing countries exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet gatt said the combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them chile colombia philippines south korea and thailand had higher exports

japan trade surplus will grow again in 1987 oecd japan trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 as sales of japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd said in its latest half yearly review of the world economy the oecd said japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct but it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 thus weakening the international adjustment process it forecast slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with rise in exports of pct in 1987 and pct in 1988 as result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs the oecd outlook did not take account of the 000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to japan however oecd officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct gnp when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports the oecd outlook said continued large current account surpluses and the further build up of an already substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen it said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth the oecd said japan gross national product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986 pct growth but it said japan would continue its good performance on inflation with zero figure expected in 1987 compared to pct rise in consumer prices last year

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only shot across japan bow but also sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide officials said but robert crandall trade specialist at brookings institution think tank said shot across their bow can often result in shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the officials said the 100 pct tariffs reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the trade gap last year was record 169 billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said don think it makes lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don want trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said don think it makes lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don want trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated

france has little room for manoeuvre oecd says french industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy the organisation for economic cooperation and development said with gross domestic product likely to grow only pct this year the same rate as last year unemployment could climb to 11 pct of the workforce by mid 1988 from its present 10 pct it said in an annual review of the french economy the report said the french economy was increasingly ill adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets france poor export performance reflects geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average and substantial loss of market share in the past 18 months it said pointing to likely widening of the french trade deficit to around billion dlrs this year from billion in 1986 it warned that further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries this could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non oecd area which accounts for almost quarter of french exports it said until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to slowdown in inflation to around two pct annual rate this year and early next the oecd said written mainly in december last year the report took no account of rise in oil prices early in 1987 and pct surge in january consumer prices caused partly by the government deregulation of service sector tariffs we took bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one oecd official commented oecd officials said the january data and rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs barrel average assumed in the report indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around or three pct the government last week revised its forecast up to between and pct from two pct against last year pct but the oecd backed the government view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival west germany could fall to just one pct this year it said on the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits for the disinflationary process to continue and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability it is essential that wage restraint continue it said

economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the in 1986 will get bigger this time next year the will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects reduction in japan trade surplus this year but manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in 1986 the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit for 1986 the trade gap with taiwan rose to 15 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13 billion in 1985 while the bilateral trade deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary data show that the growth trend is continuing the trade shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up 24 pct from year earlier the gap with korea was 700 mln dlrs up 24 pct from year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain trade surplus for three to five years as way to cut its 44 billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on 700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan trade surplus with the will fall in 1987 the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to 675 000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985 the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the takes 90 pct of korea computer products exports 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan overall trade surplus to grow to 18 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15 billion last year and korea to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the lot of korea and taiwan exports to the have been at japan expense said richard koss at general motors corp february paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with sizeable lag economists say the has not said how much it thinks the taiwan and korea currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the dollar has risen about 15 pct since september 1985 while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel wendt and so far pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far protectionism will get given the administration free trade stance it hard to see that anything
